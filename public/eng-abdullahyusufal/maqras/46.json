They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, \"If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!\" If any one's trial is intended by Allah, thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment"
