Said one of them, \"How long have ye stayed (here)?\" They said, \"We have stayed (perhaps) a day, or part of a day.\" (At length) they (all) said, \"Allah (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here.... Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town: let him find out which is the best food (to be had) and bring some to you, that (ye may) satisfy your hunger therewith: And let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform any one about you"
