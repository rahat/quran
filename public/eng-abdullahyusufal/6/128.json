Much (toll) did ye take of men.\" Their friends amongst men will say: \"Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us.\" He will say: \"The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as Allah willeth.\" for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge"
