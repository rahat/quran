    "text": "When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: \"Allah will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army: Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused.\" but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said: \"This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.\" but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: \"How oft, by Allah's will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere"
