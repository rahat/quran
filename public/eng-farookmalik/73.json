Allah has the measures of the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep it up, so He has turned to you in Mercy, therefore, read from the Qur’an as much as you easily can. He knows that there may be some sick people among you, and some others who travel through the land to seek Allah’s bounty; and yet some others fighting for the cause of Allah. Therefore, read as much of the Qur’an as you easily can. Establish the Salah (five time daily prayers) and pay the Zakah (poor due), and give to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you will send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, which will be much better and greater in reward. Seek Allah’s forgiveness, surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
