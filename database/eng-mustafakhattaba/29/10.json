    "text": "There are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but when they suffer in the cause of Allah, they mistake ˹this˺ persecution at the hands of people for the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they surely say ˹to the believers˺, “We have always been with you.” Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all beings"
