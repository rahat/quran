    "text": "And when some distress afflicted the human being, he calls to his Lord as one who turns in repentance to Him. Again, when He granted him divine blessing from Himself, he forgets that for which he had been calling to Him before and he laid on rivals to God to cause others to go astray from His way. Say: Take joy in thy ingratitude for a while. Truly, thou art of the Companions of the Fire"
