    "text": "Said a believing man of the family of Pharaoh, who keeps back his belief: Would you kill a man because he says: My Lord is God, and he drew near you with the clear portents from your Lord? And if he be one who lies, then, on him will be his lying. And if he be one who is sincere, then, will light on you some of what he promises. Truly, God guides not him who is one who is excessive, a liar"
