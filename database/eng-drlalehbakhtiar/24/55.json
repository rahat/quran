    "text": "God promised those who have believed among you and did as the ones in accord with morality, that He will make them successors in the earth, even as He made of those before them successors and He will establish for them their way of life firmly by which He was content with them and He will substitute a place of sanctuary in place of their fear: They shall worship Meâ€”ascribe nothing as partners with Me. And whoever was ungrateful after that, then, those, they are the ones who disobey"
