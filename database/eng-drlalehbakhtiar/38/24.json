    "text": "David said: Certainly, he did wrong to thee in asking for thy ewe in addition to his ewes. And, truly, many partners in business are insolent, one to another, but those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, and they are few. And David thought that We tried him and he asked for forgiveness of his Lord and fell down as one who bows down penitent.â€¡"
