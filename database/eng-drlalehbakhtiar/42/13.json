    "text": "He laid down the law of the way of life for you, that with which He charged Noah and what We revealed to thee and that with which We charged Abraham and Moses and Jesus. Perform the prescribed way of life and be not split up in it. Troublesome for the ones who are polytheists is that to which thou hast called them. God elects for Himself whomever He wills and guides the penitent to Himself"
