    "text": "And to Midian God sent their brother Shuayb. He said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god other than He. Surely, a clear portent drew near you from your Lord so live up to the full measure and the balance and diminish not the things of humanity nor make corruption in and on the earth after things were made right. That will be better for you if you had been ones who believe"
