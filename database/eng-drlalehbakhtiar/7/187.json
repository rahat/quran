    "text": "They ask thee about the Hour, when will it berth? Say: The knowledge of that is only with my Lord. None will display its time but He. It was heavy, hidden in the heavens and the earth. It will approach you not but suddenly. They will ask thee as if thou hadst been one who is well-informed about it. Say: The knowledge of that is only with God, but most of humanity knows not"
