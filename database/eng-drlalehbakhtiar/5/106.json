    "text": "O those who believed! Have testimony between you when death attended anyone of you. At the time of bequeathing, have two possessors of justice from among yourselves or two others from among others if you traveled through the region and the affliction of death lit on you. You will detain them both after the formal prayer. And they will swear by God. If you were in doubt about them, have them say: We will not exchange it for a price even if he had been possessing kinship. And we will not keep back testimony of God. Truly, we, then, would be among the ones who are perverted"
