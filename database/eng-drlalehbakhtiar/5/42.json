    "text": "They are ones who hearken to lies, the ones who devour the wrongful. Then, if they drew near thee, then, give thou judgment between them or turn aside from them. And if thou hast turned aside from them, then, they will never injure thee at all. And if thou hadst given judgment, then, give judgment between them with equity. Truly, God loves the ones who act justly"
