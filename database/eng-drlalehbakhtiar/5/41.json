    "text": "O Messenger! Let them not dishearten theeâ€”those who compete with one another in ingratitude among those who said: We believed with their mouths while their hearts believe not. ^And among those who became Jews^ are ones who hearken to lies, ones who hearken to folk of others who approach not thee. They tamper with the words out of context. They say: If you were given this, then, take it, but if you are not given this, then, beware! And for whomever God wants to test, thou wilt never have sway over him against God at all. Those are whom God wants not to purify their hearts. For them in the present is degradation. And for them in the world to come is a tremendous punishment"
