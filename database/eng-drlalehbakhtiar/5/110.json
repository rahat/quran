Remember My divine blessing on thee and on the one who is thy mother, when I confirmed thee, Jesus, with the hallowed Spirit so that thou hast spoken to humanity from the cradle and in manhood and when I taught thee the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel and when thou hast created from clay the likeness of a bird with My permission and thou hast breathed into it and it becomes a bird with My permission and thou hast cured one blind from birth and the leper with My permission and when thou hast brought out the dead with My permission and when I limited the Children of Israel from thee when thou hadst drawn near them with the clear portents. And those who were ungrateful among them said: This is nothing but clear sorcery"
