    "text": "And the Jews said: The hand of God is one that is restricted! Restricted were their hands! And they were cursed for what they said.â€¢ Nay! His hands are ones that are stretched out: He spends how He wills. And, certainly, many of them increase by what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord in defiance and in ingratitude. And We cast among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindled a fire of war, God extinguished it. And they hasten about corrupting in and on the earth. And God loves not the ones who make corruption"
