But thou hast concealed in thyself what God is One Who Shows and thou hast dreaded humanity whereas God has a better right that thou hast dreaded Him. So when Zayd satisfied the necessary formality, We gave her to thee in marriage so that there be no fault for ones who believe in respect of the spouses of their adopted sons when they (m) satisfied the necessary formality. And the command of God had been one that is accomplished"
