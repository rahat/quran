And whomever thou wilt be looking for of whom thou hadst set aside, there is no blame on thee to receive her again. That is likelier that will be refreshed their (f) eyes and they (f) not feel remorse and may they (f) be well-pleased with what thou hadst given them (f), all of them (f). And God knows what is in your hearts. And God had been Knowing, Forbearing"
