    "text": "O those who believed! Enter not the houses of the Prophet for food unless permission be given to you without being ones who look for the proper time. And when you were called to enter, when you have eaten your meal, then, disperse, and be not one who lingers for conversation. Truly, such had been to harass the Prophet and he is ashamed to ask you to leave. But God is not ashamed before The Truth. And when you asked his wives for sustenance, then, ask them (f) from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their (f) hearts. And it had not been for you to harass the Messenger of God nor marry you his spouses after him ever. Truly, that would have been serious with God"
