And shave not your heads until the sacrificial gift reaches its place of sacrifice. Then, whoever had been sick among you, or has an injury of his head, then, a redemption of formal fasting, or charity or a ritual sacrifice. And when you were safe, then, whoever took joy in the visit and the pilgrimage to Makkah then whatever was feasible of a sacrificial gift. Then, whoever finds not the means, then, formal fasting for three days during the pilgrimage to Makkah and seven when you returned, that is ten completely. That would be for he whose people are not ones who are present at the Masjid al-Haram. And be Godfearing of God and know that God is Severe in repayment"
