    "text": "And the parable of those who spend their wealth looking for the goodwill of God and for confirming their souls is like the parable of a garden on a hillside. A heavy downpour lit on it. Then, it gave its harvest double. And even if lights not on it a heavy downpour, then a dew. And God is Seeing of what you do"
