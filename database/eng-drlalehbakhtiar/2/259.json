    "text": "Or like the one who passed by a town and it was one that has fallen down into ruins. He said: How will God give life to this after its death? So God caused him to die for a hundred years. Again, He raised him up. He said: How long hadst thou lingered in expectation? He said: I lingered in expectation for a day or some part of a day. He said: Nay. Thou hadst lingered in expectation a hundred years. Then look on thy food and thy drink. They are not spoiled. And look on thy donkey. We made thee a sign for humanity. And look on the bones, how We set them up. Again, We will clothe them with flesh. So when it became clear to him, he said: I know that God is Powerful over everything"
