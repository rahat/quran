    "text": "These are the Messengers. We gave advantage, some of them over some others.â€¢ Of them are those to whom God spoke and some of them He exalted in degree. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear portents and confirmed him with the hallowed Spirit. And if God willed, those who were after them have fought one another after the clear portents drew near them, except they were at variance. And some of them believed, while some of them were ones who are ungrateful. And if God willed, they would not have fought one another, except God accomplishes what He wants"
