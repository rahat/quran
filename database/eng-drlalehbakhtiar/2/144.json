    "text": "Surely, We see the going to and fro of thy face toward heaven. Then, We will turn thee to a direction of formal prayer that thou wilt be well pleased with it. Then, turn thy face to the direction of the Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you had been, turn your faces to its direction. And, truly, those who were given the Book know that it is The Truth from their Lord, and God is not One Who is Heedless of what they do"
