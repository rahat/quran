    "text": "Again, you are theseâ€”killing yourselves, and driving out a group of people among you from their abodes, to support one another against them in sin and deep seated dislike. And if they approach you as prisoners of war, you redeem them, although expelling them is that which is forbidden to you. Then, believe you in some of the Book, and are ungrateful for some? Then, what will be the recompense of whoever commits that among you, but degradation in this present life? And on the Day of Resurrection, they will be returned to the hardest punishment. And God is not One Who is Heedless of what you do"
