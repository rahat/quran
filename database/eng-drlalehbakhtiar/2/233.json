    "text": "And the ones who are mothers will breast feed their (f) children for two years completely for whoever wanted to fulfill breast feeding. And on one to whom a child is born is their (f) provision and their clothing (f) as one who is honorable. No soul is placed with a burden, but to its capacity. Neither the one who is a mother be pressed for her child, nor the one to whom a child is born for his child. And on one who inherits is the like of that. While if they both wanted weaning by them agreeing together and after consultation, then, there is no blame on either of them. And if you wanted to seek wet-nursing for your children, then, there is no blame on you when you handed over what you gave as one who is honorable. And be Godfearing of God. And know that God is Seeing of what you do"
