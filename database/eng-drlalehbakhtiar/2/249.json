    "text": "So when Saul set forward with his army he said: Truly, God is One Who Tests you with a river. So whoever would drink of it, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, truly, he is of me, but he who scoops up with a scooping of his hand. So they drank of it, but a few of them. Then, when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: There is no energy for us today against Goliath and his armies. Said those who think they truly would be ones who encounter God: How often a faction of a few vanquished a faction of many with the permission of God! And God is with the ones who remain steadfast"
