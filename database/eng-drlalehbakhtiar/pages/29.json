God knew that you had been dishonest to yourselves so He turned to you in forgiveness and pardoned you. So now lie with them (f) and look for what God prescribed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread becomes clear to you from the black thread at dawn. Again, fulfill the formal fasting until night. And lie not with them (f) when you are ones who cleave to the places of prostration. These are the ordinances of God. Then, come not near them. Thus, God makes His signs manifest to humanity so that perhaps they will be Godfearing"
