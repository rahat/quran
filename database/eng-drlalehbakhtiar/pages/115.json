And if thou hast turned aside from them, then, they will never injure thee at all. And if thou hadst given judgment, then, give judgment between them with equity. Truly, God loves the ones who act justly"

The Prophets give judgment with it, those who submitted to God, for those who became Jews and the rabbis and learned Jewish scholars who committed to memory the Book of God and they had been witnesses to it. So dread not humanity, but dread Me. And exchange not My signs for a little price. And whoever gives not judgment by what God caused to descend, those, they are the ones who are ungrateful"

Then, whoever was charitable and forgives it, it will be an atonement for him. And whoever gives judgment not by what God caused to descend, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust"
