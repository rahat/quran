    "text": "God had not been forsaking the ones who believe to what you are in until He differentiates the bad from what is good. And God will not inform about the unseen, but God elects from His Messengers whom He wills. So believe in God and His Messengers. And if you believe and are Godfearing, then, for you there is a sublime compensation"
