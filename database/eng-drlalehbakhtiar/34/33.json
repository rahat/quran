It was your planning by nighttime and daytime when you commanded us to be ungrateful to God and to assign rivals to Him. And they will keep their self-reproach secret when they will see the punishment and We assigned yokes around the necks of those who were ungrateful. Are they given recompense but for what they had been doing"
