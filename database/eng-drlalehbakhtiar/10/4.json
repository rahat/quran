    "text": "To Him is your return, altogether. The promise of God is true. It is He Who begins the creation. Again, He will cause it to return so that He may give recompense to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality with equity. And those who are ungrateful, for them is a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they had been ungrateful"
