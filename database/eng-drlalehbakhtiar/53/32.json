    "text": "those who avoid the major sins and the indecencies but the lesser offenses. Truly, thy Lord is One Who is Extensive in forgiveness. He is greater in knowledge of you when He caused you to grow from the earth and when you were an unborn child in the wombs of your mothers. So you make not pure yourselves. He is greater in knowledge of him who was Godfearing"
