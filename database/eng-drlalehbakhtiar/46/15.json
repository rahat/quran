    "text": "And We charged the human being with kindness to ones who are his parents. His mother carried him painfully and she painfully brought him forth. And the bearing of him and the weaning of him are thirty months. When he was fully grown, having come of age and reached forty years he said: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for Thy divine blessing, that with which Thou wert gracious to me and to ones who are my parents and that I do as one in accord with morality so that Thou be well-pleased and make things right for me and my offspring. Truly, I repented to Thee and, truly, I am of the ones who submit to God"
