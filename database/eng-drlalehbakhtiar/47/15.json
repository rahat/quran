    "text": "This is the parable of the Garden which was promised the ones who are Godfearing: In it are rivers of unpolluted water and rivers of milk, the taste of which is not modified and rivers of intoxicants delightful to ones who drink and rivers of clarified honey, and in it for them all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Is this like ones who will dwell forever in the fire and they were given scalding water to drink so that it cuts off their bowels"
