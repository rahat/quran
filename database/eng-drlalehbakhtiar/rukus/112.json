Say: Who caused the Book to descend that was brought about for Moses as a light and guidance for humanity? You make it into parchments. You show them some of it and conceal much of it. And you were taught what you know not, you nor your fathers. Say: God revealed it. Again, forsake them playing, engaging in their idle talk"
