And to bar from the Masjid al-Haram, and expelling people from it are more deplorable with God. And persecution is more deplorable than killing. And they cease not to fight you until they repel you from your way of life, if they are able. And whoever of you goes back on his way of life, then, dies while he is one who is ungrateful, those, their actions were fruitless in the present and in the world to come. And those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever"
