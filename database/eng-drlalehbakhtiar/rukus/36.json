He said: I give life and cause to die. Abraham said: Truly, God brings the sun from the East, so bring thou the sun from the West! Then, he who was ungrateful was dumfounded. And God guides not the unjust folk"

So God caused him to die for a hundred years. Again, He raised him up. He said: How long hadst thou lingered in expectation? He said: I lingered in expectation for a day or some part of a day. He said: Nay. Thou hadst lingered in expectation a hundred years. Then look on thy food and thy drink. They are not spoiled. And look on thy donkey. We made thee a sign for humanity. And look on the bones, how We set them up. Again, We will clothe them with flesh. So when it became clear to him, he said: I know that God is Powerful over everything"
