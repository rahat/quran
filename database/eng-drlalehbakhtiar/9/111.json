    "text": "Truly, God bought from the ones who believe themselves and their properties. For them is the Garden! They fight in the way of God so they kill and are slain. It is a promise rightfully on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran. And who is more true to His compact than God? Then, rejoice in the good tidings of the bargain that you made in trading with Him. And that, it is the winning the sublime triumph"
