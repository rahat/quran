    "text": "They swear by God that they said not against the Prophet but, certainly, they said the word of ingratitude and they were ungrateful after their submission to God. And they were about to do something that they never attain. And they sought revenge but that God would enrich them and His Messenger with His grace. And if they repent, it would be better for them. And if they turn away, God will punish them with a painful punishment in the present and in the world to come. And there is not for them on earth either a protector or a helper"
