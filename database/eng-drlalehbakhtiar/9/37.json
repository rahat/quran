    "text": "Truly, the postponing a Sacred Month is an increase in ingratitude. By it are caused to go astray those who were ungrateful, for they permit it a year, and forbid it a year, so that they agree with the period that God forbade, and they permit what God forbade. Made to appear pleasing to them was the evil of their actions. And God guides not the folk, the ones who are ungrateful"
