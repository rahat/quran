A speaker from amongst them said: \"How long have you stayed\" They said: \"We stayed a day or part of a day.\" He said: \"Your Lord is surely aware how long you stayed, so send one of you with these stamped coins of yours to the city, and let him see which is the tastiest food, and let him come with a provision of it. And let him be careful and let no one take notice of you"
