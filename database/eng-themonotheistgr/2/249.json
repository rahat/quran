    "text": "So when Saul set out with the soldiers, he said: \"God will test you with a river, whoever drinks from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste from it except one scoop with his hand is with me.\" They all drank from it, except a few of them. So when he and those who believed with him crossed it, they said: \"We have no power today against Goliath and his soldiers!\" But the ones who understood that they would meet God said: \"How many a time has a small group beaten a large group by God's leave, and God is with the patient ones"
