    "text": "Did the news come to you of the person who debated with Abraham regarding his Lord, while God had given him a kingship Abraham said: \"My Lord is the One who gives life and death,\" he said: \"I bring life and death.\" Abraham said: \"God brings the sun from the east, so you bring it from the west.\" The one who disbelieved was confounded! And God does not guide the wicked people"
