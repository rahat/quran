    "text": "Those who consume financial interest, they do not rise except as the one who is being beaten by the devil out of direct touch. That is because they have said: \"Trade is like financial interest.\" While God has made trade lawful, and He has forbidden financial interest. Whoever has received understanding from His Lord and ceases, then he will be forgiven for what was before this and his case will be with God. But whoever returns, then they are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide eternally"
