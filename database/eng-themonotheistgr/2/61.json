    "text": "And you said: \"O Moses, we will not be patient to one type of food, so call for us your Lord that He may bring forth what the Earth grows of its beans, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.\" He said: \"Would you trade that which is lowly with that which is good\" Descend to Egypt, you will have in it what you have asked for.
