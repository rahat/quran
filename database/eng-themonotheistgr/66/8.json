    "text": "O you who believe, you shall repent to God a sincere repentance. It may be that your Lord will remit your sins and admit you into paradises with rivers flowing beneath. On that Day, God will not disappoint the prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will radiate around them and to their right. They will Say: \"Our Lord, keep perfect our light for us, and forgive us; You are able to do all things"
