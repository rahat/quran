And from among the Jews, there are those who listened to lies; they listened to people who never came to you; they distort the words from their context, and they Say: \"If you are given this, then take it, but if you are given anything different, then beware!\" And whoever God wants to test, then you will not posses anything for him against God. These are the ones whose hearts God did not want to cleanse; in this world they will have humiliation, and in the Hereafter they will have a great retribution"
