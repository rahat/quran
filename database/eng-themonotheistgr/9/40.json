When those who rejected expelled him, he was one of only two, and when they were in the cave, he said to his friend: \"Do not grieve, for God is with us.\" So God sent down calmness over him and He supported him with soldiers that you did not see, and He made the word of those who rejected be the lowest, and God's word be the highest. God is Noble, Wise"
