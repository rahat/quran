    "text": "O you who believe, be God's supporters, as Jesus the son of Mary said to his disciples: \"Who are my supporters towards God\" The disciples said: \"We are God's supporters.\" Thus, a group from the Children of Israel believed, and another group rejected. So We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they were successful"
