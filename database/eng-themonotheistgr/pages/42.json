And had God wished, the people after them would not have fought after the proofs had come to them, but they disputed, some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. Had God wished they would not have fought, but God does whatever He wishes"

His throne encompasses all of the heavens and the Earth and it is easy for Him to preserve them. He is the High, the Great"
