They drive you and the messenger out, simply because you believe in God, your Lord. If you are mobilizing to struggle in My cause, seeking My blessings, then how can you secretly love them I am fully aware of everything you conceal, and what you declare. And whosoever of you does this, then he has gone astray from the right path"
