And if those who are still dependants seek marriage, then marry them off if you find that they are ready, and give them from the wealth of God which He has bestowed upon you. And do not force your daughters into marriage when they have desired independence, in order that you may make a gain in the goods of this worldly life. But if anyone has compelled them, then for their compulsion, God is Forgiving, Merciful"

Light upon light, God guides to His light whom He pleases. And God sets forth parables for mankind, and God is aware of all things"
