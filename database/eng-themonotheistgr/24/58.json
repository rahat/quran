    "text": "O you who believe, let those who are your dependants and have not yet attained puberty request your permission regarding three times: Before the dawn contact-method, and should you take off your attire from being outdoors, and after the evening contact-method. These are three private times for you. Other than these times, it is not wrong for you or them to intermingle with one another. God thus clarifies the revelations for you. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise"
