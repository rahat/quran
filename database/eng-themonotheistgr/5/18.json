    "text": "And the Jews and the Nazarenes said: \"We are God's children, and His loved ones.\" Say: \"Then why does He punish you for your sins\" No, you are merely humans from what He has created. He forgives whom He pleases, and He punishes whom He pleases. And to God is the sovereignty of heavens and Earth and all that is in-between, and to Him is the destiny"
