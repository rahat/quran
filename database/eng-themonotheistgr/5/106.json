    "text": "O you who believe, witnessing a will if death is approaching to one of you shall be done by two who are just amongst you. Or, if you have ventured out in the land, then two others may suffice if death is approaching you; you will hold them after the contact-method, and let them swear by God if you have doubt: \"We will not purchase with it any price, even if he was a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of God, or else we are then of the sinners"
