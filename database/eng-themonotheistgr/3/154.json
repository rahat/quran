    "text": "Then He sent down to you after the worry sanctity in sleepiness, it overtook a group of you; and another group was worried about themselves, they were thinking about God other than the truth, the thoughts of the days of ignorance. They Say: \"Why are we involved in this affair\" Say: \"The entire affair is for God.\" They hide in their souls what they do not show to you, they Say: \"If we had a say in this affair then none of us would have been killed here.\" Say: \"If you were inside your own homes, then the ones who have been marked for death would have gone forth to their resting place.\" God will test what is in your chests and bring out what is in your hearts. God is Knowledgeable as to what is in the chests"
