As for those who have disease in their hearts, they will follow what is similar from it seeking to confuse, and seeking to derive an interpretation. But none know its interpretation except God and those who are well founded in knowledge, they Say: \"We believe in it, all is from our Lord.\" And none will remember except the people of understanding"
