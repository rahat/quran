    "text": "Allah has not put two hearts in a personâ€™s body: nor does He regard your wives whom you divorce through Zihar (divorcing a wife saying: from now on you are as my mother, depriving her conjugal rights yet keeping her like a slave nor letting her marry anyone else) as your mothers: nor does He regard your adopted sons as your sons. These are mere words which you utter with your mouths; but Allah declares the Truth and guides you to the Right Way"
