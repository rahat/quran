    "text": "They are ever reluctant to assist you. Whenever they are in danger, they look towards you with their eyes rolling as though they were at the point of death, but when they are out of danger, they will come to greet you with their sharp tongues in greed for gain. Such people have no faith. Allah has made all their deeds null and void, and this is easy for Allah"
