    "text": "O Prophet, remember when you said to the one (Zaid, Prophet's adopted son) whom Allah as well as you had favored: \"Keep your wife in wedlock and fear Allah.\" You sought to hide in your heart what Allah intended to reveal; you were afraid of the people whereas it would have been more appropriate to fear Allah. So when Zaid divorced his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there remains no hindrance for the believers to wed the wives of their adopted sons if they divorced them. And Allahâ€™s Command had to be carried out"
