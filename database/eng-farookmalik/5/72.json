    "text": "Certainly they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is Christ the son of Mary.\" While Christ himself said: \"O children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever commits shirk (joins partners with Allah), Allah will deny him the paradise, and the hellfire will be his home. There will be no helper for the wrongdoers"
