    "text": "Allah did in fact make a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve chieftains from among them and said: \"I am with you; if you establish Salah (prayers) pay Zakah, believe in My Messengers, support them and give a generous loan to Allah (spend in charity), I will certainly forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. However, if any one of you, after this, violates this covenant, he will indeed go astray from the Right Way"
