Indeed Our Messenger has now come to you making clear to you the teaching of the Right Way, after a long break in the series of the Messengers, so that you may not be able to say, \"No one has come to give us good news or to warn us.\" Now someone has come to give you good news and warn you so listen to him. Allah has power over everything"
