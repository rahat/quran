    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say: \"We are the children of Allah and His beloved ones.\" Ask them, \"Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay! In fact you are human beings like others which He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and He punishes whom He pleases. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the final refuge"
