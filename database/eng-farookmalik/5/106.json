    "text": "O believers! When death approaches any one of you, let two just men from among yourselves act as witnesses at the time of making your last will; or from the non-Muslims if you are travelling through the land and the calamity of death overtakes you. If you doubt their honesty, detain them after prayer and let them both swear by Allah: \"We will not sell our testimony for any price, even to a relative, and we will not hide the testimony which we will be giving for the sake of Allah; for we shall be sinners if we do so"
