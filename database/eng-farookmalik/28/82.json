    "text": "Your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses for His work whom He pleases. It is not for them (pagans) to choose indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision for whom He wills and restricts it from whom He pleases. If Allah had not been gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us too. Alas! We did not remember that the disbelievers never attain felicity"
