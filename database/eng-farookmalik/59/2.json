    "text": "It is He Who drove the disbelievers from among the People of the Book (reference is to the Jewish tribe of Banu Al-Nadir) out of their homes at the first banishment. You did not think that they would ever go out; and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah, but the wrath of Allah came to them from where they never expected - which cast such terror into their hearts - that they destroyed their homes by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson from this example! O people of insight"
