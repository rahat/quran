    "text": "Whatever spoils from the dwellers of the township Allah has bestowed on His Messenger, shall belong to Allah, His Messenger, Messenger's relatives, and to the orphans, the needy and the travellers in need; so that it may not become the property of the rich among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it and from whatever he forbids you, refrain from it. Fear Allah; for Allah is stern in retribution"
