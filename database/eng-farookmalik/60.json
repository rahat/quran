Would you show them friendship, when they have denied the truth that has come to you and have driven the Messenger and yourselves out of your homes, simply because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If it was indeed to strive in My way, and to seek My good pleasure that you left your homes, how can you befriend in secret? I know all that you conceal, and all that you reveal. Any of you who does this, he indeed has gone astray from the Right Way"

We renounce you. Enmity and hate shall reign between us forever until you believe in Allah, the One and Only God.\" But do not emulate what Abraham said to his father: \"I will pray for your forgiveness, although I have no power to get anything for you from Allah.\" Their collective prayer was: \"Our Lord! In You we have put our trust, to You we turn in repentance and to You is our final goal"
