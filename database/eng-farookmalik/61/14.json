    "text": "O believers! Be the helpers of Allah, just as Jesus the son of Mary said to his disciples: \"Who will be my helper in the cause of Allah?\" And the disciples responded: \"We will be your helpers in the cause of Allah.\" Then a group from the children of Israel believed in him (Jesus) and another group disbelieved. We aided the believers against their enemies, so they became victorious"
