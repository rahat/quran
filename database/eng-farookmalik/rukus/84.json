The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary was no more than a Messenger of Allah and His Word \"Be\" which He bestowed on Mary and a Spirit from Him which took the shape of a child in her womb. So believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not say: \"Trinity\".\" Stop saying that, it is better for you. Allah is only One Deity. He is far above from the need of having a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the Earth. Allah Alone is sufficient for protection"
