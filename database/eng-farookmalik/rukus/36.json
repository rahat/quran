When Abraham said: \"My Lord is He Who has power to give life and to cause death.\" He replied: \"I too have the power to give life and to cause death.\" Abraham said: \"Well, Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; just make it rise from the west.\" Thus the unbeliever was confounded; Allah does not guide the evildoers"

He exclaimed: \"How can Allah bring this dead township back to life?\" Thereupon Allah caused him to die, and after one hundred years brought him back to life.

When this all was shown clearly to him he said: \"Now I know that Allah has power over everything"
