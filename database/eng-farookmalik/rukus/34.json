When he and those who believed with him crossed the river, they said: \"We have no power left this day against JaLut (Goliath) and his warriors.\" But the believers, who knew they would meet Allah, replied: \"It has often happened that a small group, by the grace of Allah, has vanquished a mighty army. Allah is with those who endure with patience"

To some Allah spoke directly; others He raised high in ranks; to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah wanted, the people who received the clear signs would not have fought against each other; but they disputed as a result, there were some who believed while others rejected. Yet If Allah wanted, they would not have fought each other; but Allah does what He intends"
