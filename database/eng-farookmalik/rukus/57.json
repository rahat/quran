They say (to themselves): \"If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts.
