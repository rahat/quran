Let your servants and those children who have not yet attained puberty ask your permission before coming in to see you on three occasions: before Fajr Salah (dawn prayer), at noon when you put off your clothes, and after the Isha Salah (night prayer). These are your three times of privacy. At other times, there is no blame on you if you, or they, go around visiting one another. Thus Allah makes His revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"

There is no blame on you whether you eat together or apart; however, when you enter the houses, you should greet one another with the greeting of peace prescribed by Allah blessed and pure. Thus Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may grow in understanding"
