These people are the truthful and these are the pious"

But if anyone is pardoned by his aggrieved brother, then bloodwit (a ransom for manslaughter) should be decided according to the common law and payment should be made with gratitude. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. Now, whoever exceeds the limits after this, shall have a painful punishment"
