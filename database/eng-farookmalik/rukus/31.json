The reasonable cost of their maintenance and clothing will be the responsibility of the child’s father. No one should be charged with more than they can afford. Neither a mother should be made to suffer on account of her child nor a father on account of his child. The father’s heirs are under the same obligation. But if, with mutual agreement, they both decide to wean the child, there is no blame on them. If you decide to have a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you provided you pay what you have promised to pay in an honorable manner. Fear Allah and beware that Allah observes your actions"

Do not confirm the marriage tie until the prescribed waiting period expires. You should know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so fear Him. Bear in mind that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"
