Yet, these two angels never taught magic to anyone without saying: \"We have been sent to tempt you; do not renounce your faith.\" In spite of this warning, those people kept on learning from the angels, the magic of which could cause discord between husband and wife; although they could harm none with it except with Allah’s permission. They learned, indeed, what harmed them and did not profit them; even though they knew fully well that the buyers of magic would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. Surely, they sold their souls for a bad price, if they could understand it"
