    "text": "Do not follow anyone except the one who follows your own religion.\" O Muhammad, tell them: \"The only true guidance is the guidance of Allah.\" These people of the Book do not believe that revelation could be sent to anyone besides themselves, like that which has been sent to you; or that they will ever argue with you in the presence of your Lord. Tell them: \"For sure, grace is in the hands of Allah: He bestows it on whom He pleases; Allah has boundless knowledge"
