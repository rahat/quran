    "text": "He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are decisive they are the foundation of the Book - while others are allegorical. Those whose hearts are infected with disbelief follow the allegorical part to mislead others and to give it their own interpretation, seeking for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. Those who are well grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in it; it is all from our Lord.\" None will take heed except the people of understanding"
