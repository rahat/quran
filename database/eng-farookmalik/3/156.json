Be not like the unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are traveling through the earth or engaged in fighting: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.\" This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do"
