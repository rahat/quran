    "text": "And if you divorce them before the marriage is consummated but after the fixation of a dowry, give them half of their dowry unless the woman wants to waive it or the man in whose hand is the marriage tie agrees to forego (and pay the dowry in full). To forego and give full dowry is closer to piety. Do not forget to show kindness to each other. Surely Allah observes your actions"
