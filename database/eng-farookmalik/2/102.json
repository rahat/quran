    "text": "and accepted what the Satans falsely attributed to the kingdom of Solomon; not that Solomon was an unbeliever, it was the Satans who were unbelievers; they taught witchcraft to the people and that which was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut in the city of Babylon. Yet, these two angels never taught magic to anyone without saying: \"We have been sent to tempt you; do not renounce your faith.\" In spite of this warning, those people kept on learning from the angels, the magic of which could cause discord between husband and wife; although they could harm none with it except with Allahâ€™s permission. They learned, indeed, what harmed them and did not profit them; even though they knew fully well that the buyers of magic would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. Surely, they sold their souls for a bad price, if they could understand it"
