    "text": "So if a husband divorces his wife three times, it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and gotten the divorced. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they reunite in marriage, provided they think that they can keep the limits of Allah. Such are the limits of Allah which He makes clear to the people of understanding"
