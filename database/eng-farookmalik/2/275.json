    "text": "Those who live on usury will not rise up before Allah except like those who are driven to madness by the touch of Satan. That is because they claim: \"Trading is no different than usury, but Allah has made trading lawful and usury unlawful. He who has received the admonition from his Lord and has mended his way may keep his previous gains; Allah will be his judge. Those who turn back (repeat this crime), they shall be the inmates of hellfire wherein they will live forever"
