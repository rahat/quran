    "text": "We have made you a moderate Ummah (nation) so that you may testify against mankind and that your own Messenger may testify against you. We decreed your former Qiblah only to distinguish those who are the real followers of the Messenger from those who would back away from the faith. It was indeed a hard test except for those whom Allah has guided. Allah wants not to make your faith fruitless. Allah is Compassionate and Merciful to mankind"
