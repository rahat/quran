    "text": "Allah does not mind using the similitude of a gnat or an even more insignificant creature to teach a lesson. Those who believe, know that it is the truth from their Lord; but the unbelievers say: \"What does Allah mean by such a similitude?\" By such a similitude Allah confounds many and enlightens many. He confounds none except the transgressors"
