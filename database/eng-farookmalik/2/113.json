    "text": "The Jews say: \"The Christians are not on the right track,\" and the Christians say: \"It is the Jews who are not on the right track,\" yet both read their Holy Books (Torah or Gospel). And those who have no knowledge (the pagan Arabs) say like to what both of them say; so Allah will judge between them in their dispute on the Day of Judgment"
