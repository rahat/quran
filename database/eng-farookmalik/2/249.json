    "text": "When TaLut marched forth with his army, he announced: \"Allah will test you at a certain river; anyone who will drink from its water shall cease to be my soldier, and those who will not drink to quench their thirst with its water except a sip or so from the hollow of their hands shall fight on my side.\" They all drank from it, inspite of this warning, except a few of them. When he and those who believed with him crossed the river, they said: \"We have no power left this day against JaLut (Goliath) and his warriors.\" But the believers, who knew they would meet Allah, replied: \"It has often happened that a small group, by the grace of Allah, has vanquished a mighty army. Allah is with those who endure with patience"
