    "text": "Allah is the Wali (Protector) of those who believe, He brings them out of the depth of darkness and leads them into the light. As for the unbelievers, whose wali (protector) is Taghut (forces of Satan), he takes them out of the light and leads them into the depths of darkness. As a result they will become the companions of the Hell fire and shall live therein forever"
