    "text": "When you divorce women and they have reached the end of their waiting period (‘Iddat) either allow them to stay with honor or let them go with kindness; but you should not retain them to harm them or to take undue advantage; if anyone does that he wrongs his own soul. Do not take Allah’s revelations as a joke. Remember the favors of Allah upon you and the fact that He sent down the Book and Wisdom for your guidance. Fear Allah and know that Allah has knowledge of everything"
