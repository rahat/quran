    "text": "They ask you about menstruation. Tell them: \"This is a discomfort; therefore, keep away from women (do not have sexual intercourse) during their menstrual periods and do not approach them until they are clean again. When they have cleansed themselves then you may approach them in the manner Allah has enjoined for you. Surely Allah loves those who turn to Him in repentance and keep themselves clean"
