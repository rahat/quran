    "text": "Have you not reflected on what the leaders of the children of Israel demanded from one of their Prophets after the death of Moses? \"Appoint for us a king,\" they said, \"and we will fight in the cause of Allah.\" The Prophet replied: \"What if you refuse to fight when you are ordered to do so?\" They replied, \"How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we along with our children were driven out of our homes?\" But when, on their demand, they were ordered to fight, all refused except a few of them. Allah knows the evildoers"
