    "text": "These are the Messengers (which We have sent for the guidance of mankind). We have exalted some above others. To some Allah spoke directly; others He raised high in ranks; to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah wanted, the people who received the clear signs would not have fought against each other; but they disputed as a result, there were some who believed while others rejected. Yet If Allah wanted, they would not have fought each other; but Allah does what He intends"
