    "text": "There is no blame on you if you make a proposal of marriage during their waiting period openly or keep it in your hearts. Allah knows that you will naturally cherish them in your hearts; however, be careful not to make any secret agreement, and if you wish to marry, speak to them in an honorable manner. Do not confirm the marriage tie until the prescribed waiting period expires. You should know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so fear Him. Bear in mind that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"
