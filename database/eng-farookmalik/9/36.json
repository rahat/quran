    "text": "The number of months ordained by Allah is twelve in the Book of Allah since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these, four are sacred; that is the established principle of Deen. Therefore, do not wrong yourselves by violating them. But you may fight against the pagans in all these months if they fight against you in all of them. Know that Allah is with the righteous"
