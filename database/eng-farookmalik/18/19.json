One of them asked: \"How long have you been here?\" The others answered: \"Maybe we have been here for a day or part of a day.\" Finally they concluded: \"Our Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. Anyhow let one of us go to the city with this silver coin, and let him find who has the purest food and bring us something to eat. Let him behave with caution and let him not disclose our whereabouts"
