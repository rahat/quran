    "text": "Recall when your sister went to them and said: 'May I tell you of the one who can take care of this child?â€™ Thus did We return you back to your mother to comfort her eyes and that she might not grieve. Again when you killed a man, We saved you from great distress and We tested you through various trials. You stayed a number of years with the people of Median. Now you have come here per Our pre-ordainment, O Moses"
