    "text": "These pagans say that such and such cattle and crops are reserved, in the name of such and such temple, and no one should eat except those whom we permit - in fact these restrictions they themselves have imposed. Then there are some animals which they have prohibited from riding or carrying loads, and there are still other animals over which they do not pronounce the name of Allah. They have falsely attributed all these things to Him. Soon He will requite them for their invented lies"
