    "text": "Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come down to them or are they waiting to be given a certain sign of your Lord! On the Day when that certain sign of your Lord appears, the belief will not profit that soul which did not believe before, or who, while professing to believe did not do good deeds. Say to them: \"Wait if you will; we too are waiting"
