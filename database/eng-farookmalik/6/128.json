You seduced mankind in great number.\" And their votaries from among mankind will say: \"Our Lord, we have both enjoyed each other's fellowship but alas! Now we have reached the end of our term which You had decreed for us.\" Then Allah will say: \"Now hellfire is your dwelling-place; you will live therein forever unless Allah ordains otherwise.\" Surely your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable"
