    "text": "It is He who has created all kinds of plants, trellised and untrellised, the palm trees, the field crops with produce of different kinds, the olives and pomegranates, similar in kind yet different in taste. Eat of their fruit in their season and give away their Zakah on the harvest day. Do not be spendthrift, surely He does not love the spendthrifts"
