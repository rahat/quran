    "text": "It is He Who sends down rainwater from the sky and therewith produces vegetation of all kinds: He brings forth green crops producing grain piled up in the ear, palm-trees laden with clusters of dates hanging within reach, gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates; though their fruit resembles in kind yet is different in variety. Look at their fruits as they yield and ripen. Behold! In these things there are signs for true believers"
