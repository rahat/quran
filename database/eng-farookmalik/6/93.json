    "text": "Who can be more wicked than the one who invents a lie against Allah, or says: \"This was revealed to me,\" while nothing was revealed to him? Or the one who says: \"I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed?\" If you could only see these wrongdoers when they are in the agonies of death and the angels stretch forth their hands saying, \"Take out your soul! Today you will be rewarded with a disgraceful punishment for saying falsehood against Allah which you had no right to say and showing arrogance against His revelations"
