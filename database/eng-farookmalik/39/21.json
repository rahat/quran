    "text": "Do you not see how Allah sends down water from the sky which penetrates the earth and come out through springs? With it He brings forth a variety of crops with different colors, then they wither and you see them turning yellow, and then finally He crumbles them to dust. Surely, in this example, there is a lesson for the people of understanding"
