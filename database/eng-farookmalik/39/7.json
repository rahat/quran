    "text": "If you disbelieve, then you should know that Allah does not need you. He does not like ingratitude from His servants. Therefore, if you are grateful He is pleased with you. On the Day of Judgement, no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Ultimately, all of you have to return to your Lord. Then He will tell you the truth of all that you did in this life. Surely He knows even the secrets of your hearts"
