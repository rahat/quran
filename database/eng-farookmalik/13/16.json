    "text": "Ask them: \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" If they hesitate to respond, say: \"Allah.\" Then ask them: \"When this is the fact, why do you take other deities, besides Him, who do not control any benefit or harm even to themselves, as your protectors?\" Say: \"Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?\" If that is not so, then, have their shoraka' (other deities they worship) created any thing like His creation which has made the matter of creation doubtful for them? Say: \"Allah Alone is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Irresistible"
