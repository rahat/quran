    "text": "What! Are they so audacious that they ascribe partners to Allah, Who watches minutely over each and every soul and knows all that it does? O Prophet ask them: If Allah Himself has set them up as His partners, then tell me their names! Do you mean to inform Him of something new that He Himself does not know on this earth, or do you merely utter empty words?‚Äù Nay! Indeed their foul devices seem fair to the unbelievers, for they have been debarred from the Right Way; and there is none to guide those whom Allah has let go astray"
