Surely all things are subject to Allah’s command. Have not yet the believers been satisfied that if Allah wanted, He would have certainly guided the whole of mankind? As for the unbelievers, the disaster will not cease to afflict them every now and then or to crouch at their very doorsteps because of their misdeeds, until the promise of Allah is fulfilled; surely Allah will not fail His promise"
