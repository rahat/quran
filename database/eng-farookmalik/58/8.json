    "text": "Have you not seen those who, though forbidden to hold secret counsels, persistently do what was forbidden? They hold secret counsels among themselves for sin, hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. Yet when they come to you, they greet you in words which Allah does not greet you with, and say to themselves: \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" Hell is enough for them, they shall burn in its flames, what an evil destination"
