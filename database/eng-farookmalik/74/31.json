    "text": "We have appointed none but angels as wardens of the fire; and We have made their number a trial for the unbelievers, so that the People of the Book may be convinced and the faith of the true believers may be increased, and that no doubts will be left for the People of the Book and the believers, and that those in whose hearts there is a disease and the disbelievers may say: \"What could Allah mean by this parable?\" Thus, Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He pleases. No one knows the forces of your Lord except Himself, and this (Qur'an) is nothing but a reminder to mankind"
