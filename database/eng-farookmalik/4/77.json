    "text": "Have you not seen those who were told to restrain their hands from fighting, establish Salah (regular prayers) and pay Zakah (regular charity). Now when at length they are commanded to fight, lo! A group of them fear people as they should have feared Allah, or even more than that, and say: \"Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? Could you delay its implementation for a while?\" Tell them: \"The enjoyment of this worldly life is short, life of the hereafter is much better for those who fear Allah, and rest assured that you will not be wronged equal to the fiber of a date-stone"
