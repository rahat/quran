    "text": "In regard to inheritance Allah commands you concerning your children: that the share of a boy shall be twice that of a girl. In the case where there are more than two girls, their share will be two thirds of the estate; but if there is only one girl, her share will be one half of the estate. If the deceased left children behind, each of the parents shall get one sixth of the estate, but if the deceased left no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother shall get one third of the estate, but if the deceased left brothers and sisters, then the mother will get one sixth of it. The distribution in all cases shall be after fulfilling the terms of the last will and the payment of debts. With regards to your parents and your children, you do not know who is more beneficial to you, therefore, Allah issued this ordinance. Surely Allah is the Knowledgeable, Wise"
