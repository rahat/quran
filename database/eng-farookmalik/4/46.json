    "text": "Among the Jews there are some who take the words out of their context and utter them with a twist of their tongues to slander the true Deen (faith) and say: \"We hear and we disobey;\" and \"Hear, may you (O Muhammad) hear nothing!\" And \"Ra'ina\" (an ambiguous word meaning: \"listen, may you become deaf,\" or \"our shepherd,\" or \"in judeo-Arabic language conveying the sense of \"our evil one\"). If only they had said: \"We hear and we obey;\" and \"Hear us;\" and \"Unzurna (\"look upon us,\" or \" pay attention to us\"): it would have been better for them and more proper. Due to all this Allah has cursed them for their unbelief. In fact with the exception of a few, they have no faith"
