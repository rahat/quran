    "text": "The People of the Book ask you to bring down for them a book from Heaven. From Moses they demanded an even harder miracle than that. They asked him: \"Make us see Allah with our own eyes.\" As a result of their wickedness, the thunderbolt overtook them. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear revelations. After all that, We still pardoned them and gave to Moses clear authority"
