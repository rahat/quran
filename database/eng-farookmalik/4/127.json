    "text": "They ask your decision concerning the women. Tell them: Allah makes His decision concerning them and along with it reminds you about those commandments, recited to you in the Book (The Qur'an), relating to orphan girls to whom you do not give their lawful rights and to whom you do not wish to marry. He also reminds you regarding the helpless children, and to stand firm for justice to orphans. Whatever good you do, Allah surely knows it"
