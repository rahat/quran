If Allah grants you a victory, they say: \"Were we not with you?\" And if the unbelievers gain success, they will say to them: \"Were we not strong enough to fight against you? Yet we protected you from the believers (Muslims).\" Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will not leave the way for the unbelievers to triumph over the believers"
