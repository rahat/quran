    "text": "Observe the orphans through testing their abilities until they reach the age of marriage, then if you find them capable of sound judgment, hand over to them their property; and do not consume it wastefully in haste lest they grow up to demand it. If the guardian is well-off, he should not take compensation from the orphan's property, but if he is poor let him take a just and reasonable remuneration. When you hand over their property to them, call in some witnesses; even though Allah is sufficient in taking the accountability"
