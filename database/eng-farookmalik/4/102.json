    "text": "When you, O Muhammad, are with them, leading their Salah (prayer in the state of war), let one party of them stand up to pray with you, armed with their weapons. After they finish their prostrations, let them withdraw to the rear and let the other party who have not yet prayed come forward to pray with you; and let them also be on their guard, armed with their weapons. The unbelievers wish to see you neglect your arms and your baggage, so that they could suddenly attack to overpower you all in one stroke. However, there is no blame on you if you lay aside your arms because of heavy rain or because you are sick, but you should still be on your guard. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers"
