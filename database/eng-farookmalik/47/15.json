    "text": "Here is the parable of the paradise which the righteous have been promised: it has rivers the water of which will never be stagnant, rivers of milk whose taste never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it they will have all kinds of fruits, as well as forgiveness from their Lord. Can such people be compared to those who shall dwell in hell forever, and they will be given scalding water which will cut their intestines into pieces"
