To some Allah spoke directly; others He raised high in ranks; to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah wanted, the people who received the clear signs would not have fought against each other; but they disputed as a result, there were some who believed while others rejected. Yet If Allah wanted, they would not have fought each other; but Allah does what He intends"

Who can intercede with Him without His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them. They cannot gain access to any thing out of His knowledge except what He pleases. His throne is more vast than the heavens and the earth, and guarding of these both does not fatigue Him. He is the Exalted, the Supreme"
