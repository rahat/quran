Do not grieve for those who plunge headlong into unbelief; those who say with their tongues: We believe, but have no faith in their hearts; and do not grieve for those Jews, who listen to lies and spy for other people who had never come to you. They tamper with the words of Allah and take them out of their context and say: \"If you are given such and such commandment, accept it; but if it is other than this, reject it.\" If Allah intends to put anyone to trial, you have no authority in the least to save him from Allah. Such people are those whose hearts Allah does not desire to purify; they will have humiliation in this world and a grievous punishment in the Hereafter"
