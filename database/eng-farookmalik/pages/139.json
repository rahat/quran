You have transcribed it on separate sheets, publishing some and suppressing much of that given knowledge, which neither you nor your forefathers previously possessed.\" If they do not answer, then just say: \"Allah\" and leave them alone with the discourse of their useless arguments"

Today you will be rewarded with a disgraceful punishment for saying falsehood against Allah which you had no right to say and showing arrogance against His revelations"
