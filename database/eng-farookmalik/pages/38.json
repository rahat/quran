Allah knows that you will naturally cherish them in your hearts; however, be careful not to make any secret agreement, and if you wish to marry, speak to them in an honorable manner. Do not confirm the marriage tie until the prescribed waiting period expires. You should know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so fear Him. Bear in mind that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"

To forego and give full dowry is closer to piety. Do not forget to show kindness to each other. Surely Allah observes your actions"
