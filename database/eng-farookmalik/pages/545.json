It is they in whose hearts Allah has inscribed faith and has strengthened them with a spirit of His own. He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. Allah will be well pleased with them, and they will be well pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Beware! Surely it is the party of Allah that will be successful"

You did not think that they would ever go out; and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah, but the wrath of Allah came to them from where they never expected - which cast such terror into their hearts - that they destroyed their homes by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson from this example! O people of insight"
