Surely all things are subject to Allah’s command. Have not yet the believers been satisfied that if Allah wanted, He would have certainly guided the whole of mankind? As for the unbelievers, the disaster will not cease to afflict them every now and then or to crouch at their very doorsteps because of their misdeeds, until the promise of Allah is fulfilled; surely Allah will not fail His promise"

O Prophet ask them: If Allah Himself has set them up as His partners, then tell me their names! Do you mean to inform Him of something new that He Himself does not know on this earth, or do you merely utter empty words?” Nay! Indeed their foul devices seem fair to the unbelievers, for they have been debarred from the Right Way; and there is none to guide those whom Allah has let go astray"
