But I ask this to reassure my heart.\" Allah said: \"Take four birds; train them to follow your direction, cut their bodies into pieces and scatter those pieces on hilltops, then call them back; Allah will bring them back to life and they will come to you right away. Thus you will know that Allah is All-powerful and Wise"

Do not make your charity worthless by reminders of your generosity or by injury to the recipients feelings, like those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. Their parable is like a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil; a heavy rain falls, leaving it just a bare stone. Such people will not gain any reward that they thought they had earned. Allah does not guide the unbelievers"
