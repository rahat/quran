Do not take Allah’s revelations as a joke. Remember the favors of Allah upon you and the fact that He sent down the Book and Wisdom for your guidance. Fear Allah and know that Allah has knowledge of everything"

This is enjoined on everyone amongst you who believes in Allah and the Last Day. This is more virtuous and chaste for you; Allah knows what you do not know"

The reasonable cost of their maintenance and clothing will be the responsibility of the child’s father. No one should be charged with more than they can afford. Neither a mother should be made to suffer on account of her child nor a father on account of his child. The father’s heirs are under the same obligation. But if, with mutual agreement, they both decide to wean the child, there is no blame on them. If you decide to have a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you provided you pay what you have promised to pay in an honorable manner. Fear Allah and beware that Allah observes your actions"
