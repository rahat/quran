He creates you in the wombs of your mothers in stages, one after another, in three layers of darkness. This is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the sovereignty. There is no god but Him. How can you then turn away from Him"

On the Day of Judgement, no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Ultimately, all of you have to return to your Lord. Then He will tell you the truth of all that you did in this life. Surely He knows even the secrets of your hearts"
