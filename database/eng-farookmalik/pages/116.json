Therefore, judge between people according to Allah’s revelations and do not yield to their vain desires, diverging from the truth which has come to you. We have ordained a law and a Way of life for each of you. If Allah wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you; therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to Allah; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you dispute"

If they reject your Judgment, then know that it is Allah’s wish to scourge them for some of their sins. In fact most of the people are transgressors"
