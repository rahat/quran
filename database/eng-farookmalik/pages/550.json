They are not lawful to the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful to them. Return to their unbelieving husbands what they have spent on them. There is no blame on you if you marry such women, provided you give them their dowers. Do not hold on to your marriages with unbelieving women. Demand what you have spent on them and let the unbelievers do the same. This is the order of Allah which He has decreed between you. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"

Fear Allah, in Whom you believe"
