That will be more suitable , so that you may not deviate from the Right Way"

If the guardian is well-off, he should not take compensation from the orphan's property, but if he is poor let him take a just and reasonable remuneration. When you hand over their property to them, call in some witnesses; even though Allah is sufficient in taking the accountability"
