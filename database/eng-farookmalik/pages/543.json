It cannot be that three persons converse in secret and He is not the fourth of them; or five persons converse in secret and He is not the sixth of them; whether fewer or more, wherever they may be, He is with them. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of what they have done, surely Allah has knowledge of all things"

They hold secret counsels among themselves for sin, hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. Yet when they come to you, they greet you in words which Allah does not greet you with, and say to themselves: \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" Hell is enough for them, they shall burn in its flames, what an evil destination"
