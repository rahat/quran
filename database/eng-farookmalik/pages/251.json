They are like a man who stretches forth his hands to the water and asks it to reach his mouth. It cannot reach his mouth this way; likewise the prayer of the unbelievers is nothing but a fruitless effort"

Or can darkness and light be equal?\" If that is not so, then, have their shoraka' (other deities they worship) created any thing like His creation which has made the matter of creation doubtful for them? Say: \"Allah Alone is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Irresistible"

By such examples Allah depicts truth and falsehood. As for the scum, it is thrown away, being worthless, but that which is useful for the mankind remains behind on the earth. In this way Allah cites examples to make His message clear"

As for those who do not respond to Him - even if they had all that is in the earth, and as much besides, to offer as a ransom in order to save themselves from punishment, it would be of no use. They are the ones who will have terrible reckoning; their abode will be hell - what an evil resting place"
