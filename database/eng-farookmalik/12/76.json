    "text": "After this Joseph first began to search the packs of his stepbrothers before the pack of his own brother (Benjamin). Finally he took it out of his brother’s pack. Thus We directed Joseph. He could not seize his brother under the King’s law; but Allah willed otherwise. We exalt in ranks whom We please, He is the One Whose knowledge is far greater than the knowledge of all others"
