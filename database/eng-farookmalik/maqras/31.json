If the deceased left children behind, each of the parents shall get one sixth of the estate, but if the deceased left no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother shall get one third of the estate, but if the deceased left brothers and sisters, then the mother will get one sixth of it. The distribution in all cases shall be after fulfilling the terms of the last will and the payment of debts. With regards to your parents and your children, you do not know who is more beneficial to you, therefore, Allah issued this ordinance. Surely Allah is the Knowledgeable, Wise"
