This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. Now, whoever exceeds the limits after this, shall have a painful punishment"

Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread of night, then complete your fast till nightfall. Do not approach your wives during I‘htikaf (retreat in the mosques in last ten days of Ramadhan). These are the limits set by Allah: do not ever violate them.
