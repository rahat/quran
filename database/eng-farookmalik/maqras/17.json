To some Allah spoke directly; others He raised high in ranks; to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah wanted, the people who received the clear signs would not have fought against each other; but they disputed as a result, there were some who believed while others rejected. Yet If Allah wanted, they would not have fought each other; but Allah does what He intends"

His throne is more vast than the heavens and the earth, and guarding of these both does not fatigue Him. He is the Exalted, the Supreme"

Allah asked: \"How long did you remain here?\" Ezra replied: \"Perhaps a day or part of a day.\" Allah said: \"Nay! You have remained here for one hundred years: now just have a look at your food and drink; they are not rotten; and then look at your donkey and see that his very bones have decayed. We have done this to make you a Sign for mankind. Look at the bones of your donkey how We bring them together then clothe them with flesh and bring him back to life!
