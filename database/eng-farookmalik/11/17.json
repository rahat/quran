    "text": "Can they be like those who have clear revelations from their Lord and to whom a witness from Himself recites it, and they have the Book of Moses before them - a guidance and a blessing? Can such people deny the revelation of Al- Qurâ€™an? No of course not, rather such people will believe in this, but those factions who do not believe shall have their promised place in the Hellfire. So, O Prophet, do not be in any doubt about it; it is the Truth from your Lord, even though most people do not believe so"
