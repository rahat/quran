    "text": "He has ordained for you the same Deen (way of life - Islam) which He enjoined on Noah - and which We have revealed to you O Muhammad - and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus: \"Establish the Deen of Al-Islam and make no division (sects) in it.\" Intolerable for the pagans is that to which you O Muhammad call them. Allah chooses for His service whom He wills, and guides to His Way only those who turn to Him in repentance"
