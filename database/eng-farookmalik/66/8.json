    "text": "O believers! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance. It may well be that your Lord will remove from you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. On that Day Allah will not humiliate the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will shine in front of them and on their right, and they will say: \"Our Lord! Perfect our light for us and grant us forgiveness, for You have power over all things"
