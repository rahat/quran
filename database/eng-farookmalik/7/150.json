    "text": "When Moses came back to his people, he was extremely angry and sorrowful, and he said: \"What an evil thing you have done in my place in my absence! Have you tried to hasten the retribution of your Lord?\" He put down the Holy Tablets and seized his brother by the hair of his head and dragged him closer. Haroon (Aaron) cried: \"O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and almost killed me; do not make my enemies happy over me and do not count me among the wrongdoers"
