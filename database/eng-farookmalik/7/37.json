Such people will have their destined portion from the Book (what was written for them to receive during their life on earth); until when Our messengers (angels of death) arrive to take away their souls, they will ask: \"Where are those gods whom you used to invoke besides Allah?\" They will reply: \"They have forsaken us\" and they will bear witness against themselves (admit) that they were indeed kuffar (unbelievers)"
