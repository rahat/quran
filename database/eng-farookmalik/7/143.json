    "text": "When Moses came to Our appointed place and his Lord spoke to him, he asked: \"O my Lord! Give me power of sight to see You.\" He answered: \"You cannot see Me. Look at the mountain; if it remains firm in its place then soon you might be able to see Me\". When his Lord manifested His glory on the mountain, it turned into small pieces of fine dust and Moses fell down unconscious. When Moses recovered he said: \"Glory be to You! Accept my repentance and I am the first of the believers"
