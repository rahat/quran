    "text": "Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six YÃµme (time periods) and is firmly established on the throne of authority. He makes the night cover the day and the day follow the night automatically. He created the sun, the moon and the stars, and made them subservient to His will. Take note: His is the creation, and His is the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
