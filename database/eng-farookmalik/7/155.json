    "text": "Moses chose seventy men from his nation to accompany him to Our place of meeting. On their way when they were seized by a violent earthquake, he prayed: \"O my Lord! Had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them long ago, and myself too. Would You destroy us for the offense committed by some fools among us? That trial was ordained by You, to confound whom You willed and to guide whom You pleased. You are our Guardian, therefore, forgive us and have mercy on us; for You are the best of all forgivers"
