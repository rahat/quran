    "text": "We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and when his thirsty people asked him for water, We revealed to Moses: \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Thereupon twelve springs gushed out from the rock, each tribe was specified its drinking place. We caused the clouds to cast shadow over them and sent down to them manna and salva for their food, saying: \"Eat of the pure things We have provided for you,\" but they rebelled and by doing so they did not harm Us but they did injustice to their own souls"
