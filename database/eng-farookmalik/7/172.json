    "text": "O Prophet, remind mankind about the incident when your Lord brought into existence the offspring from the loins of Adam and his descendants (virtually each single individual of mankind) and made them testify about themselves. Allah asked them: \"Am I not your Lord?\" They all replied: \"Yes! We bear witness that You are.\" This We did, lest you mankind should say on the Day of Resurrection: \"We were not aware of this fact that You are our Lord and that there will be a Day of Judgment"
