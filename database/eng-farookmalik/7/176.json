    "text": "Had it been Our will, We would have exalted him through those revelations; but he clung to this earthly life and followed his own desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you chase him he lolls out his tongue and if you leave him alone he still lolls out his tongue. Such are those who deny Our revelations, tell them these parables, so that they might think over their behavior to Our revelations"
