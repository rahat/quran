    "text": "Do you not turn your sight toward those who were forbidden secret meetings, but yet return to that which they were forbidden? And they hold secret counsels among themselves for immorality, hostility, and to ignore the messenger, and when they come to you, they greet you, but not as God greets you. And they say to themselves, “Why does God not punish us for our words?” Enough for them is hell. In it they will burn, and terrible is that destination"
