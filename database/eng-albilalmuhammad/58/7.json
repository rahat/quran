    "text": "Do you not see that God knows all that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret meeting between three, that He does not make the fourth, nor between five that He does not make the sixth, nor between fewer nor more. He is in their presence wherever they are. In the end He will tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day of Accountability, for God has full knowledge of all things"
