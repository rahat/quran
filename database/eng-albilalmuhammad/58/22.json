    "text": "You will not find any of the people who believe in God and the Last Day, loving those who resist God and His messenger, even though they be their parents or their children, or their brothers, or other family members. For them He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself, and He will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing through them, to dwell therein forever. God will be well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are of God. And truly it is the people of God who will achieve felicity"
