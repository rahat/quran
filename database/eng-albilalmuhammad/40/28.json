    "text": "A believing person from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith said, “Will you slay a person because he says, ‘My Lord is God?’ When he has indeed come to you with guidance from your Lord? And if he were a liar, on him is his lie, but if he is telling the truth, then there will fall on you, something of that which he warns you. Truly God does not guide one who transgresses and lies"
