And because you have come out to strive in My way, and to seek My favor. Thus do not hold secret conversations, nor keep ties and friendships with them, for I know all that you conceal and all that you reveal. And any of you who does this has strayed from the straight path"

Except when Abraham said to his father, “I will pray for forgiveness for you, though I have no power on your behalf from God, “Our Lord, in You do we trust, and to You do we turn in repentance, to You is our final goal.”"

But pay the unbelievers what they have given for dowries, and there will be no blame on you if you marry them on payment of their dowry to them. But do not hold on to ties to unbelieving women. Ask for what you have given as their dowries, and let the unbelievers ask for what they have given as dowries. Such is the command of God. He judges between you, and God is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom"
