    "text": "Who can do more wrong than one who invents a lie against God or says, “I have received inspiration,” when he has received none, or who says, “I can reveal the like of what God has revealed.” If you could only see how the wrong-doers fare in the flood of confusion at death. The angels stretch out their hands saying, “Yield up your souls, this day will you receive your reward, a penalty of shame, because you used to tell lies against God, and sarcastically reject His signs.”"
