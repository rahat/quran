    "text": "Say, â€œCome, I will rehearse what God has made sacred. Join not anything as equal with Him, be good to your parents, and do not kill your children for fear of want. We care for you and for them. Come not near shameful deeds, whether open or secret, do not take life that God has made sacred, except by way of justice and law. This is what He commands you, that you may learn wisdom"
