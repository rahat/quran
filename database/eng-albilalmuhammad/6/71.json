    "text": "Say, \"Shall we indeed call on others besides God, call on things that can do us neither good nor harm? And should we turn on our heels after receiving guidance from God, like one whom Satan has made into a fool, wandering lost through the earth, with his friends calling, ‘come to us’, vainly guiding him to the path.” Say, “God's guidance is the guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Guardian Evolver of the cosmos"
