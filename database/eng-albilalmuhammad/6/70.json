    "text": "Leave those alone who take their religion to be play and entertainment, and are deceived by the life of the present. But proclaim this, “That every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own deeds. It will find for itself no protector nor intercessor except God. If they offered any ransom, none will be accepted. Such is the end of those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts. They will have for drink boiling water, for a punishment most terrible, for they persisted in rejecting God.”"
