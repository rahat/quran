    "text": "Those who give partners to God will say, “If God had wished, we would not have given partners to Him, nor would our fathers, nor should we have had any taboos,” as did their fathers argue falsely, until they tasted Our punishment. Say, “Have you any proof? If so, bring it before us. You follow nothing but speculation. You do nothing but lie.”"
