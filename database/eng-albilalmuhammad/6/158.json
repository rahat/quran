    "text": "Are they waiting to see if the angels will come to them, or your Lord Himself, or some of the signs of your Lord? The day that some of the signs of your Lord will come, no good will it do for one to believe in them then, if he believed not before, nor earned righteousness through his faith. Say, “Wait, we too are waiting.”"
