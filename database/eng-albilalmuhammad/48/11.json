    "text": "The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to you, “We were engaged in looking after our flocks and herds, and our families. Can you then ask forgiveness for us?” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Who then has any power to intervene on your behalf with God, if His will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? No, for God is well acquainted with all that you do"
