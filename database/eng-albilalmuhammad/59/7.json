    "text": "What God has bestowed on His messenger from the people of the townships belongs to God, His messenger, to family and orphans, the needy, and to displaced persons, in order that it may not circulate between the wealthy among you. So take what the messenger assigns to you, and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And be conscious of God, for God is strict in punishment"
