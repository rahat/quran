    "text": "It is He Who removed the unbelievers among the people of the Book from their homes at the first gathering. You hardly thought that they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from God, but God came to them from places they hardly expected, and casted fear into their hearts, so that they caused to be destroyed, their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the believers, take warning then, O you with eyes to see"
