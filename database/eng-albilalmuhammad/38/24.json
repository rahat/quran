    "text": "David said, “He has undoubtedly wronged you in demanding your ewe to be added to his ewes. Truly many are the partners who wrong each other. Not so do those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, they are but a few.” Then David realized that We had tried him. He asked forgiveness of his Lord, fell down bowing, and turned to God in repentance"
