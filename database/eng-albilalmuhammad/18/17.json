    "text": "You would have seen the Sun when it rose, setting to the right from their cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the open space in the middle of the cave. Such are among the signs of God. He whom God guides is rightly guided, but he whom God leaves to stray, for him will you find no protector to lead him to the right way"
