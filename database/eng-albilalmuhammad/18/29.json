    "text": "Say, “The truth is from your Lord.” Let them who want to believe, believe. And let them who want to reject it, reject it. For the wrongdoers, We have prepared a fire like the walls and roof of a tent, it will hem them in. If they ask for relief they will be granted water like melted brass which will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink, how miserable a destination"
