A voice said, “How long have you stayed here?” They said, “We have stayed a day or part of a day.” They said, “God knows best how long you have stayed here. Now send one of you with this money of yours to the town. Let him find out which is the best food and bring some to you, that you may satisfy your hunger, and let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform anyone about you"
