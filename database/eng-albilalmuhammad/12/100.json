    "text": "And he raised his parents high on the throne, and they all fell down in prostration before him. He said, â€œO my father, this is the fulfillment of my vision in the past. God has made it come true. He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you out of the desert, even after Satan had sown enmity between my brothers and me. Indeed my Lord understands best, the mysteries of all that He plans, for indeed He is full of knowledge and wisdom"
