    "text": "O messenger, when you divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed periods, and count accurately their prescribed periods, and be conscious of God, your Lord, and do not turn them out of their houses, nor should they leave, except in case they are guilty of some open lewdness, those are limits set by God, and any who transgress the limits of God, indeed wrongs his soul. You do not know if God will bring about thereafter some new situation"
