    "text": "Nor can a bearer of burdens bear anotherâ€™s burdens. If one heavily laden should call another to his load, not the least portion of it can be carried by the other, even if they are nearly related. You can only advise those who fear their Lord unseen, and establish prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul, and the destination is to God"
