    "text": "Here is a parable of the garden which the righteous are promised. In it are rivers of water incorruptible, rivers of milk of which the taste never changes, rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink, and rivers of honey, pure and clear. In it there are all kinds of fruits for them, and grace from their Lord. Can those in such bliss be compared to those who will dwell forever in the fire, and who will be given boiling water to drink, so that it cuts up their insides"
