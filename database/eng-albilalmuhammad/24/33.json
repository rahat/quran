    "text": "Let those who do not find the means for marriage keep themselves chaste until God gives them means out of His grace, and if those whom your right hand possess ask for a deed in writing to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum, give them such a deed if you know any good in them. Yes, and give them something out of the means which God has given to you. And do not force your female captives into prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that you may make a profit in the goods of this life, but if anyone compels them, then indeed because they were compelled, God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
