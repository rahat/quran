    "text": "Do you not see that God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then make them into a heap? Then you will see rain come out from their center, and He sends down from the sky, mountain masses of clouds which holds hail. He strikes with it whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases. And the vivid flash of His lightning nearly blinds the sight"
