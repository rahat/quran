    "text": "God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His light is as if there were a niche and within it a lamp. The lamp enclosed in glass. The glass as it were a brilliant star lit from a blessed olive tree, neither from the East nor from the West, whose oil is luminous, though fire does not touch it, light upon light, and God guides whom He wills to His light. God puts forward parables for humanity, and God knows all things"
