    "text": "And say to the believing women, that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty, that they should not display their ornaments, except what seems appropriate to her, that they should draw their garments over their bosoms and not display their adornment, except to their husbands, their parents, their husband’s parents, their sons, their husbands’ sons, their brothers or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their maids, or those whom their right hands possess, or male servants who do not desire them, or small children who are not aware of women’s need for privacy, and that they should not let their feet draw attention to what they conceal of their zeenah. O you believers, turn all together towards God, that you may attain bliss"
