    "text": "It is no blame on the blind, nor on those born disabled, nor on one afflicted with illness, nor on yourselves, if you all eat from your own houses, or those of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your father’s brothers or your father’s sisters, or your mother’s brothers, or your mother’s sisters, or in houses of which the keys are in your possession, or in the house of a sincere friend of yours. There is no blame on you, whether you eat together or separately, but if you enter houses, greet each other with a greeting blessed and good, as from God. Thus God makes clear the signs to you that you may understand"
