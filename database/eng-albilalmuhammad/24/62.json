When they are with him on a matter requiring collective action, they do not depart until they have asked to be excused, those who ask to be excused are those who believe in God and His messenger. So when they ask to be excused, to attend to a matter, excuse those whom you will, and ask God for their forgiveness, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
