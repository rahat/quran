Its early morning stride was a month’s journey, and its evening stride was a month’s journey, and We made a font of molten brass to flow for him, and there were jinn that worked in front of him, by the permission of his Lord, and if any of them deviated from our command, We made him taste the penalty of the blazing fire"
