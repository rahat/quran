    "text": "It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the community to refuse to follow God's messenger, or to prefer their own lives to his. Because nothing could they suffer or do that was not added to their credit as a deed of righteousness, whether they suffered thirst, or fatigue, or hunger, in the cause of God, or trod paths to anger the unbelievers, or received injury from an enemy. God does not cause the reward to be lost, for those who do right"
