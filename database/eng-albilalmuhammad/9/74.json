    "text": "They swear by God that they said nothing, but indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they did it after accepting Al-Islam. And they devised a plot which they were unable to carry out. The revenge of theirs was the return for the bounty with which God and His messenger had enriched them. If they repent, it will be best for them, but if they turn back, God will punish them with a terrible penalty in this life and in the next. They will have none on earth to protect or help them"
