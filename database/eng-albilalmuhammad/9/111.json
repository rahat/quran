    "text": "God has purchased from the believers, their persons and their goods, and for this, the garden is theirs. They fight in His cause, they slay and are slain. A promise binding on Him in reality, through the Law, the gospel, and the Quran. And who is more faithful to his covenant than God? So rejoice in the transaction which you have contracted. That is the ultimate achievement"
