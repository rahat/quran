He had no more than one companion, the two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, “Have no fear, God is with us.” Then God sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which you did not see, and humbled the word of the unbelievers, but the word of God is exalted to the heights, for God is Exalted in Might, the Wise"
