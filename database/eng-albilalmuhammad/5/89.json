    "text": "God will not call you to account for your casual promises, but He will call you to account for your contractual obligations. For atonement, feed ten indigent people on a scale of the average for your families, or clothe them, or free a slave. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days, that redeems the promises you have made. But keep your promises. God makes clear to you His signs so that you may be grateful"
