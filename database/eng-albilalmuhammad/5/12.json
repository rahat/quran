    "text": "God took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We appointed twelve leaders among them and God said, “I am with you, if you establish worship, give zakat, believe in my messengers, honor and assist them, and loan to God a handsome loan, and indeed I will remove your guilt, and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath. But if after this, any of you resists faith, he has certainly wandered from the path of righteousness.”"
