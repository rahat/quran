    "text": "O you who believe, do not kill game while in pilgrim garb. If any of you does so intentionally, the compensation is an offering brought to the Kaaba of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just people among you, or in exchange, the feeding of the indigent, or its equivalent in fasts, that he may taste of the penalty of his deed. God forgives what has passed. For retribution God will exact from him the penalty, for God is Exalted, Lord of retribution"
