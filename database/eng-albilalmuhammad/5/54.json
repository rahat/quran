    "text": "O you who believe, if any among you turn back from his faith, soon will God produce a people who He will love, as they will love Him. A people gentle with the believers, firm with the opposition, fighting in the way of God, and never afraid of the criticism of those who find undue fault. That is the grace of God which He will bestow on whom He pleases, God encompasses all, and He knows all things"
