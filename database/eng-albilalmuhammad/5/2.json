    "text": "O you who believe, do not impose on the symbols of God, nor on the sacred month. Nor on the animals brought for sacrifice. Nor on the garlands that identify such animals. Nor on the people visiting the Sacred House, seeking the bounty and blessings of their Lord. And when you come out of pilgrim garb, you may hunt. But do not let the hatred of some people who shut you out of the Sacred Masjid, lead you to transgression. Help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in harmful deeds and hatred. And be conscious of God, Who is strict in punishment"
