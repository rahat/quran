    "text": "Jews say, “God's hands are tied.” Their hands are tied, and they are cursed for what they utter. No, both His hands are wide open. He gives as He pleases, but the revelation that comes to you from God increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Among them, we have placed enmity and hatred, until the Day of Accountability. Every time they kindle the fire of war, God extinguishes it, but they strive to do wrong on earth, and God does not love those who do wrong"
