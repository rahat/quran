    "text": "Among Jews and Christians are some who say, “We are sons of God, and are his beloved.” Say, “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No, you are sons of human beings, of the human beings He has created. He forgives whom He pleases, and He punishes whom He pleases, and to God belongs the control of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between, and to Him is the final goal.”"
