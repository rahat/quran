    "text": "Forbidden to you are the meat of animals found dead, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked a name other than God, and that which has been strangled to death, or fatally hit, or falls to its death, or is gored to death, and that which has been partly eaten by a wild animal, unless you are able to slaughter it in the correct way. And forbidden is that which is sacrificed on stone, and the division by raffling with arrows, for that is impiety. This day have those who reject it given up all hope of your way of life. Yet do not fear them, but fear Me. This day have I complemented your way of life for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Al-Islam as your way of life. But if any are forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgress, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
