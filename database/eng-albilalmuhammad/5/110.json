    "text": "Then God will say, “O Jesus the son of Mary, remember My favor to you and to your mother. Behold, I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity. Behold, I taught you the Book and the Wisdom, the Law and the gospel. And behold, you make out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My permission, and you breathe into it and it becomes a real bird, by My permission, and you heal those born blind, and the lepers, by My permission. And behold, you bring forth the dead by My permission. And behold, I kept the Children of Israel from you when you showed them the clear signs, and the unbelievers among them said, ‘This is nothing but obvious deception.’ ”"
