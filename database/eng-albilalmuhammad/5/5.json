    "text": "This day all things good and pure are made permissible to you. The food of the people of the Book is permissible to you and yours is permissible to them, as are chaste women who are Believers, and chaste women among the people of the Book revealed before your time, if you give them their dowries, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret rendezvous. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the hereafter, he will be in the ranks of those who are lost"
