    "text": "O you who believe, when death approaches any of you, take witnesses among yourselves when making wills, take two just people from your brothers, or two others from outside if you are journeying through the earth and the chance of death befalls you. If you doubt their words, keep them both after prayer, and let them both swear by God, “We do not want any worldly gain, even though the beneficiary is a near relative. We will not hide the proof before God, and if we do, then behold, the sin is on us.”"
