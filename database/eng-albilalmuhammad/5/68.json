    "text": "Say, “O people of the Book, you have no grounds to stand upon unless you stand fast by the Law, the gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord.” It is the revelation that comes to you from your Lord which increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blaspheme. But do not worry about the people without faith"
