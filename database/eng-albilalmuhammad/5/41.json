    "text": "O messenger, do not let those grieve you who race each other to disbelief, whether it be among those who say, “We believe,” with their lips, but whose hearts have no faith, or it be among the Jews, some of who will listen to any lie, will listen even to others who have never so much as come to you. They take the words out of context. They say, “If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware.” If for anyone a trial is intended by God, you have no authority in the least for him against God. For them, it is not God's will to redeem their hearts. For them there is disgrace in the present, and in the hereafter a heavy punishment"
