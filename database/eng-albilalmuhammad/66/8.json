    "text": "O you who believe, turn to God with sincere repentance, in the hope that your Lord will remove from you your sins and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing through them, the day that God will not permit to be humiliated, the messenger and those who believe with him. Their light will run forward before them and by their right hands while they say, “Our Lord, perfect our light for us, and grant us forgiveness, for You have power over all things.”"
