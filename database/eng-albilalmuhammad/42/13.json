    "text": "The way He has established things for you, is the same way that He enjoined those things on Noah. Those things which We have sent by inspiration to you, and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Namely, that you should remain steadfast, and make no divisions therein. For those who worship things other than God, difficult is the way to which you call them. God chooses for Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn to Him"
