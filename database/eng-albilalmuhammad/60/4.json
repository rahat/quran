    "text": "There is for you an excellent example in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “We are clear of you and of whatever you worship besides God. We have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever, unless you believe in God, and Him alone”. Except when Abraham said to his father, “I will pray for forgiveness for you, though I have no power on your behalf from God, “Our Lord, in You do we trust, and to You do we turn in repentance, to You is our final goal.”"
