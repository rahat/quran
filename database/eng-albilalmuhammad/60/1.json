    "text": "O you who believe, do not take my enemies and yours, as friends, offering them your love, because they have rejected the truth that has come to you, and have driven out the messenger and yourselves, because you believe in God, your Lord. And because you have come out to strive in My way, and to seek My favor. Thus do not hold secret conversations, nor keep ties and friendships with them, for I know all that you conceal and all that you reveal. And any of you who does this has strayed from the straight path"
