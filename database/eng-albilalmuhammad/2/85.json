    "text": "After this it is you, the same people who slay those among yourselves, and banish a group of you from their homes, assist others against them in wrong and transgression, and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, though it was not permissible for you to banish them. So is it only parts of the Book that you believe in, and do you reject the rest? But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this, except disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Accountability, they will be assigned to the most terrible penalty, for God is not unmindful of what you do"
