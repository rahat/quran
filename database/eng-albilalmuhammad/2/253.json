    "text": "Some of the messengers We endowed with gifts above others. Among them is one to whom God spoke. Others He raised through levels. To Jesus the son of Mary We gave guidance and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among themselves after guidance came to them. But they were divided, some believing and others rejecting. If God had willed they would not have fought each other, but God fulfills His plan"
