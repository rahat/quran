    "text": "Their prophet said to them, “God has appointed Talut as king over you.” They said, “How can he have authority over us when we are better fitted than he to have authority, and when he has not been given great wealth?” He said, “God has chosen him above you and has given him great knowledge and substance. God grants His authority to whom He pleases. God cares for all and He knows all things.”"
