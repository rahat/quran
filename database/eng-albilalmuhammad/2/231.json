    "text": "If you divorce women and they fulfill the terms of their â€˜iddat, either take them back on fair terms or let them go on fair terms. But do not take them back to injure them or to take undue advantage of them. If anyone does that, he wrongs his own self. Do not treat God's signs without regard, but solemnly rehearse God's favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and the Wisdom for your instruction. And be conscious of God, and know that God is well acquainted with all things"
