    "text": "God, there is no god but He, the Living, the Self-Sufficient, the Eternal. No exhaustion can overcome Him, nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there that can intercede in His presence except as He permits? He knows what is before, after, and behind them. And they will not grasp any of His knowledge except as He wills. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them, for He is the Most High, the Supreme"
