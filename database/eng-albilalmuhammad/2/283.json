    "text": "If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then pledge with your possessions. And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust and let him be regardful of his Lord. And do not conceal evidence, and whoever conceals it, his heart is then tainted with corruption. And God knows all that you do"
