    "text": "They ask you concerning women’s menses. Say, “It is a renewal. Thus decline them during their menses, nor go unto them until they are renewed. But once renewed you may approach them in the manner ordained for you by God. For God loves those who constantly turn to Him, and He loves those who refine themselves.”"
