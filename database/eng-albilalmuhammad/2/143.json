    "text": "Thus we have made you a balanced community, that you might be witnesses over the nations, and the messenger a witness over you. And We appointed the qibla from that which you were used to, only to make evident he who followed the messenger and he who would turn on his heels. Indeed it was momentous, except for those guided by God. And never would God make your faith meaningless, for God is to all people full of kindness, the Merciful Redeemer"
