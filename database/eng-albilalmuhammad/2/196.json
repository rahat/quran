    "text": "And complete the Hajj and ‘Umra in service of God. But if you are prevented, send something of value which is manageable. And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. And if any of you are sick, or has an ailment in his scalp, he should in exchange either fast, feed the poor, or offer sacrifice. When ready, if anyone wishes to continue the ‘Umra, on to the Hajj, he must make an offering, such as he can afford. But if he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in the Sacred Masjid. And be aware of God, and know that God is strict in punishment"
