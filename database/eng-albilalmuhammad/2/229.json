    "text": "Divorce no more than twice. After that, the parties should either hold together on fair terms, or separate with kindness. It is not permissible for you to take back any of your gifts from your wives, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God. If you indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits set down by God, there is no blame on either of them if she negotiates with it. These are the limits established by God, so do not transgress them. If any transgress the limits prescribed by God, they are doing wrong"
