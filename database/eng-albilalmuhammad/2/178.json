    "text": "O you who believe, the law of equality is prescribed to you in the case of homicide. The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the woman for the woman. Also, if any pardon is made by the sibling of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate them with gratitude. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. After this, whoever exceeds the limits will be in grave penalty"
