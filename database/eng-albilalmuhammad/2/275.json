    "text": "Those who devour usury will not stand except as one stands who Satan, by his touch, has driven to madness. Because they say, “Trade is like usury.” But God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who cease after receiving direction from their Lord will be forgiven for their past, and their case is for God. But those who continue are companions of the fire, they will live therein forever"
