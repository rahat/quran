    "text": "O you who believe, give of the good things that you have earned, and of the fruits of the earth that We have produced for you. And do not aim at getting anything in the wrong way, in order that out of it you may give away something when you yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that God is free of all wants and worthy of all praise"
