    "text": "Divorced women should wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. And it is not permissible for them to hide what God has created in their wombs, if they have faith in God and the Last Day. And their husbands have the right to reunite in that period if they wish for reconciliation. But women have rights the same as the rights on them according to what is equitable. But men should take a final position concerning them, and God is Exalted in Power, the Wise"
