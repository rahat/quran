    "text": "There is no blame on you if you make an offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts. God knows that you cherish them in your hearts. But do not make secret promises to them except in honorable terms. Nor decide on marriage until the term prescribed is completed. And know that God knows what is in your hearts, and take heed of Him, and know that God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Understanding"
