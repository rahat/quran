    "text": "Humankind was once one nation. And God sent messengers with good news and warnings, and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge between the people in matters wherein they differed, but the people of the Book, after the clear signs came to them, did not differ among themselves, except through stubborn refusal. God, by His grace, guided the believers to the truth concerning that wherein they differed, for God guides whom He wills to a path that is straight"
