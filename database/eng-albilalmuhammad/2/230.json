    "text": "So if a husband divorces his wife irrevocably, he cannot re-marry her after that, until after she has married a different husband and he has divorced her. In that case, there is no blame on either of them if they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by God. Such are the limits established by God which He makes plain to those who understand"
