    "text": "On no soul does God place a burden greater than she can bear. She gets every good that it earns and she suffers from every ill that she earns. Pray, “Our Lord, condemn us not if we forget or fall into error. Our Lord, lay not on us a burden like that which You laid on those before us. Our Lord, lay not on us a burden greater than we have the strength to bear. Blot out our sins, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector, and help us against those who reject it.”"
