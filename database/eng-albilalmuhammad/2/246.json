    "text": "Have you not turned your vision to the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses? They said to a prophet among them, “Appoint for us a king, so that we may fight in the cause of God.” He said, “Is it possible that if you were asked to fight that you will not fight?” They said, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of God, seeing that we were banished from our homes and from our families?” But when they were asked to fight, they turned back, except a small group among them, but God has full knowledge of those who do wrong"
