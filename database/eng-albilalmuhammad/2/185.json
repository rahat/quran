    "text": "Ramadan is the month the Quran was revealed as a guide to humanity, as proof, and as the guidance and the criterion. So every one of you who are present during that month should spend it fasting, but if anyone is ill or on a journey, the prescribed period should be made up days later. God intends good for you, He does not want to make it difficult for you, instead He wants for you to complete the prescribed period, and to praise Him, for He has guided you, so that you might be grateful"
