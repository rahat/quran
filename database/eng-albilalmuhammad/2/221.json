Nor marry disbelieving men until they believe. A slave man who believes is better than a disbeliever is, even though he is attractive to you. Disbelievers lead you to the fire, but God leads, by His grace, to the garden and forgiveness, and makes His signs clear to humanity, that they may remember"
