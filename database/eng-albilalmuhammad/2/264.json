    "text": "O you who believe, do not cancel out your charity with reminders of your generosity or by insults, like one who gives their sustenance to be seen by people, but believe neither in God nor in the Last Day. His similitude is like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil. On it falls heavy rain which leaves it a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with what they have earned, and God does not guide those who do not believe"
