    "text": "Have you not turned your vision to one who disputed with Abraham about his Lord because God had granted him power? Abraham said, “My Lord is He Who gives life and death.” He said, “I give life and death.” Abraham said, “And it is God Who causes the Sun to rise from the East, can you cause it to rise from the West?” Then he was angered, he who rejected. And God does not give guidance to those people who are wrongdoers"
