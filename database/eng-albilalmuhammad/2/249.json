    "text": "When Talut marched with the soldiers he said, “God will challenge you at the stream. If any drinks of its water, he will not go with my army. Only those who do not drink it will go with me, a little sip from the hand is excused.” But they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river, he and the faithful with him said, “This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.” But those who were convinced that they must meet God said, “How often, by God's will, has a small force vanquished a large one? God is with those who steadfastly persevere.”"
