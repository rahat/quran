    "text": "You were on the near side of the valley, and they on the far side, and the caravan was on lower ground than you. Even if you had made a mutual appointment to meet, you would certainly have failed in that appointment. But you met, so that God might accomplish a matter destined. And that those who died might die after guidance had been given. And that those who lived might live after guidance had been given. And indeed God is He Who hears and knows all things"
