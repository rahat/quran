    "text": "Those who believed, and accepted exile, and fought for the faith with their property and their persons in the cause of God, as well as those who gave them asylum and aid, these are friends and protectors of each other. As for those who believed but did not go into exile, you owe no duty of protection, until they go into exile. But if they seek your aid, it is your duty to help them. Except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance. And God sees all that you do"
