Then they understood that there was no refuge from God, only with Him. Then He turned to them, so that they could repent, for God is Oft-Returning, Mercifully Redeeming"

Because nothing could they suffer or do that was not added to their credit as a deed of righteousness, whether they suffered thirst, or fatigue, or hunger, in the cause of God, or trod paths to anger the unbelievers, or received injury from an enemy. God does not cause the reward to be lost, for those who do right"
