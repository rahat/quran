But men should take a final position concerning them, and God is Exalted in Power, the Wise"

If you indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits set down by God, there is no blame on either of them if she negotiates with it. These are the limits established by God, so do not transgress them. If any transgress the limits prescribed by God, they are doing wrong"

Such are the limits established by God which He makes plain to those who understand"
