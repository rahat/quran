By its standard, the Jews have been judged by the Prophets who bowed to God's will, by the rabbis and by the doctors of law, for to them was entrusted the protection of God's book, and they were witnesses to that. Therefore, do not fear others, but fear Me, and do not sell My signs for a miserable price. If any fail to judge by what God has revealed, they are unbelievers"
