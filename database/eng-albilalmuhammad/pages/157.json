On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord indeed brought truth. Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or can we be sent back? Then we would behave differently from our behavior in the past.” In fact, they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them lost"
