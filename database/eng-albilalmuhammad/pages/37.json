But do not take them back to injure them or to take undue advantage of them. If anyone does that, he wrongs his own self. Do not treat God's signs without regard, but solemnly rehearse God's favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and the Wisdom for your instruction. And be conscious of God, and know that God is well acquainted with all things"

No soul will have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother should be treated unfairly because of her child, nor a father because of his child. An heir should be treated the same. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If you decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided you pay the mother what you offered on fair terms. But be conscious of God, and know that God sees well all that you do"
