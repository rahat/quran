When they finish their prostrations, let them take their position in the rear, and let the other group come up which has not yet prayed. And let them pray with you, taking all precaution, and bearing arms. The unbelievers wish, if you were negligent of your arms and your gear, to assault you in a single ambush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms, because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take precaution for yourselves, for the unbelievers, God has prepared a crushing punishment"
