Did you want to induce the judgment of your Lord?” He put down the tablets, seized his brother by his hair, and dragged him to himself. Aaron said, “Son of my mother, the people indeed saw me as nothing, and nearly murdered me. Do not allow the enemies to rejoice over my misfortune, nor count me among the people of sin.”"

You are our Protector, so forgive us and give us Your mercy, for You are the best of those who forgive"
