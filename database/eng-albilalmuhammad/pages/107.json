And forbidden is that which is sacrificed on stone, and the division by raffling with arrows, for that is impiety. This day have those who reject it given up all hope of your way of life. Yet do not fear them, but fear Me. This day have I complemented your way of life for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Al-Islam as your way of life. But if any are forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgress, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"

Say, â€œPermissible to you are things good and pure, and that slaughtered by that which you have made to slaughter, in the manner God has taught you. Eat what they slaughter for you, pronounce the name of God over it, and be conscious of God, for God is swift in taking account"

The food of the people of the Book is permissible to you and yours is permissible to them, as are chaste women who are Believers, and chaste women among the people of the Book revealed before your time, if you give them their dowries, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret rendezvous. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the hereafter, he will be in the ranks of those who are lost"
