If only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance. If only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children. If no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother has a third. If the deceased left brothers or sisters, the mother has a sixth. These distributions, in all cases, are after the payment of estate tax and debt. You do not know whether your parents or your children are nearer to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by God, and God is All Knowing, All Wise"
