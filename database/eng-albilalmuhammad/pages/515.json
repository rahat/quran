            "text": "Muhammad is the messenger of God, and those who are with him are strong against unbelievers and compassionate among each other. You will see them bow and prostrate themselves, seeking grace from God, and His favor. On their faces are their marks, and are the traces of their prostration. Their similitude in the Torah, and their similitude in the gospel, is a seed that puts forth its shoot, then is made strong, then becomes thick, then stands on its own, filling those who planted it with wonder and pleasure. Meanwhile, it fills the unbelievers with rage. But God has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds, forgiveness and a great reward"
