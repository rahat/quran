For them He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself, and He will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing through them, to dwell therein forever. God will be well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are of God. And truly it is the people of God who will achieve felicity"

You hardly thought that they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from God, but God came to them from places they hardly expected, and casted fear into their hearts, so that they caused to be destroyed, their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the believers, take warning then, O you with eyes to see"
