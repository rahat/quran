We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the gospel, and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy. But monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them. We asked only the seeking for the grace of God, but that, they did not develop as they should have. Still We bestowed on those among them who believed, their reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors"
