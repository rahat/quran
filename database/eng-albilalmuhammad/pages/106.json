Say, God teaches concerning those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs, that if a man dies leaving a sister but no child, she will have half the inheritance. If a woman leaves no child, her brother inherits her portion. If there are two sisters, they will have two-thirds of the inheritance. If there are brothers and sisters, they share, the male having twice the share of the female. God makes this clear to you, so that you will not err, and God has knowledge of all things"

Nor on the people visiting the Sacred House, seeking the bounty and blessings of their Lord. And when you come out of pilgrim garb, you may hunt. But do not let the hatred of some people who shut you out of the Sacred Masjid, lead you to transgression. Help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in harmful deeds and hatred. And be conscious of God, Who is strict in punishment"
