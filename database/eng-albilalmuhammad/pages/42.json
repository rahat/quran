To Jesus the son of Mary We gave guidance and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among themselves after guidance came to them. But they were divided, some believing and others rejecting. If God had willed they would not have fought each other, but God fulfills His plan"

Who is there that can intercede in His presence except as He permits? He knows what is before, after, and behind them. And they will not grasp any of His knowledge except as He wills. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them, for He is the Most High, the Supreme"
