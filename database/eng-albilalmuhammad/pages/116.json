So judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their vain desires, diverging from the truth that has come to you. To each one among you We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but His plan is to challenge you with what He has given you. So strive as in a race to all virtues. The goal of you all is to God. It is He Who will show you the truth of that which you dispute"
