            "text": "Your Lord knows that you rise nearly two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so does a group of those with you. But God appoints night and day in due measure, He knows that you are unable to keep count of it. So He has turned to you. Therefore read of the Quran as much as is easy for you. He knows that there may be some among you in ill-health, others traveling through the land, seeking God's bounty, and others fighting in God's cause. Therefore read as much of the Quran as is easy, and establish prayer and give zakat, and loan to God a handsome loan, and whatever good you send forth for your souls, you will find it in God's presence. Yes, better and greater in reward. And seek the grace of God, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Redeeming"
