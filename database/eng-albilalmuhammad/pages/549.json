And because you have come out to strive in My way, and to seek My favor. Thus do not hold secret conversations, nor keep ties and friendships with them, for I know all that you conceal and all that you reveal. And any of you who does this has strayed from the straight path"

We have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever, unless you believe in God, and Him alone”. Except when Abraham said to his father, “I will pray for forgiveness for you, though I have no power on your behalf from God, “Our Lord, in You do we trust, and to You do we turn in repentance, to You is our final goal.”"
