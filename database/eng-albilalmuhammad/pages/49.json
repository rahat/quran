And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust and let him be regardful of his Lord. And do not conceal evidence, and whoever conceals it, his heart is then tainted with corruption. And God knows all that you do"

Pray, “Our Lord, condemn us not if we forget or fall into error. Our Lord, lay not on us a burden like that which You laid on those before us. Our Lord, lay not on us a burden greater than we have the strength to bear. Blot out our sins, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector, and help us against those who reject it.”"
