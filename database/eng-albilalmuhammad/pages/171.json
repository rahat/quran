We directed Moses by inspiration, when his people asked him for water We said, “Split the rock with your staff.” Out of it, gushed forth twelve springs. Each group knew its place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails saying, “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” Then to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own selves"
