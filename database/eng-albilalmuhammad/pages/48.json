            "text": "O you who believe, when you deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, put them in writing. Let a scribe write it down correctly for the parties involved, and the scribe should not refuse to write. God has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear his Lord and not omit any of what he owes. If the party liable is mentally deficient or weak, or unable to dictate, let his guardian dictate correctly. And get two witnesses from your men. If not two men, then a man and two women, of whom you agree to be witnesses, so that if one of the two errs, then one of the two can remind the other. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called on. Do not refuse to reduce things to writing for a future period, whether it is small or large. This is more just in the sight of God, more suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves. But if it is a transaction which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if you do not reduce it to writing, but take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract, and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If you do, it would be wrong on your part. So be regardful of God, for it is God who teaches you, and God is well acquainted with all things"
