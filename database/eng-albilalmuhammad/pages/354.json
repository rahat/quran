Yes, and give them something out of the means which God has given to you. And do not force your female captives into prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that you may make a profit in the goods of this life, but if anyone compels them, then indeed because they were compelled, God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"

The glass as it were a brilliant star lit from a blessed olive tree, neither from the East nor from the West, whose oil is luminous, though fire does not touch it, light upon light, and God guides whom He wills to His light. God puts forward parables for humanity, and God knows all things"
