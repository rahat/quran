If you are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from the offices of nature, or you have been intimate with women, and you find no water, then take for yourselves natural earth, and wash your faces and hands with it. God does not wish to make things difficult, but to refine you, and to complete his favor to you, that you may experience appreciation"
