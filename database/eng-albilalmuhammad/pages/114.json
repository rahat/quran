They take the words out of context. They say, “If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware.” If for anyone a trial is intended by God, you have no authority in the least for him against God. For them, it is not God's will to redeem their hearts. For them there is disgrace in the present, and in the hereafter a heavy punishment"
