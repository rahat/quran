For he commands them what is just and forbids them what is unjust, he encourages for them as permissible that which is good, and prohibits them from what is harmful. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the chains that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down to him, it is these who will flourish.”"
