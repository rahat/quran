Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know you were trampling, and on whose account a crime would have come to you without your knowledge, God would have allowed you to force your way. But He held back your hands, so that He may admit to His mercy those whom He wills. If they had been apart, We would certainly have punished the unbelievers among them with a terrible punishment"
