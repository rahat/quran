Christ Jesus the son of Mary was a messenger of God and His word which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and say not “Trinity.” Desist, it will be better for you, for only God is God, the One, and Glory be to Him. Far exalted is He above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enough is God as a manager of affairs"
