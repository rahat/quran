And say, “Do you then take protectors other than Him, those who have no power themselves to either benefit or to do harm?” Say, “Are the blind equal to those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?” Or do they assign to God partners who have created something like He has created, so that their creation seemed similar to them? Say, “God is the Creator of all things. He is the One, the Supreme, and Irresistible.”"

For the scum disappears as froth cast out, while that which is for the good of humanity remains on the earth"

Their abode will be hell, what a place of agony"
