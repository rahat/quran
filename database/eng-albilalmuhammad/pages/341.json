Those on whom you call other than God, cannot even create a fly, even if they all met together for the purpose, and if the fly snatches away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition, as are those whom they petition"

It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this revelation, that the messenger may be a witness for you, and you are witnesses for humanity. So establish prayer, give zakat, and hold fast to God. He is your Protector, the best to protect and the best to help. (End of Part)"
