    "text": "After the distress, He sent down calm on a company of you overcome with slumber, while another company was stirred to anxiety by their feelings, moved by wrongful doubt of God, suspicions due to ignorance. They said, “What concern is this of ours?” Say, “Indeed, this concern is entirely God's.” They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to you. They say, “If we had anything to do with this affair, we would not have been in the slaughter here.” Say, “Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death.” But all this was for God to make evident what is in your chest and to redeem what is in your hearts, for God knows well the secrets of your hearts"
