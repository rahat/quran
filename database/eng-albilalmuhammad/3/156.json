    "text": "O you who believe, do not be like the unbelievers who say of their brothers, when they are traveling through the earth or engaged in fighting, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.” This is so that God may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. And God gives life and death, and God sees well all that you do"
