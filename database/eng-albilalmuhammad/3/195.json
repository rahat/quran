    "text": "And their Lord accepted this from them and answered, “Never will I cause to be lost the work of any of you, be they male or female. You are connected, one to the other. Those who have left their homes, or have been banished from it, or suffered harm in My cause, or fought or have been slain, I will indeed remove from them their sins, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath. A reward from the presence of God, and from His presence is the best of rewards.”"
