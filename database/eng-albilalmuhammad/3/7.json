Those in whose hearts is deviation, they only follow the esoteric verses, seeking disharmony and seeking its hidden meaning. But none has the understanding of their interpretations except God and those well-grounded in the knowledge. They say, 'We believe in it, all of it is from the presence of our Guardian Evolver.\" But none will remember this, except the possessors of insight and a penetrating mind"
