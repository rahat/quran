    "text": "God indeed fulfilled His promise to you when you, with His permission, were about to annihilate your enemy, until you flinched and began disputing about the orders and did not follow them after He brought you in sight of the spoils that you desired. Among you are some who pursue the present and some who pursue the hereafter. Then He diverted you from your enemies in order to challenge you, but He forgave you, for God is full of grace to those who believe"
