    "text": "We have enjoined on the human being kindness to his parents. In pain did his mother carry him, and in pain did she give birth to him. Carrying the child and his weaning is a period of thirty months. Then, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years he says, “My Lord, bless me to be grateful for Your favors that You have bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and to do the righteous deeds that You approve of, and be gracious to me for my harmful deeds. Indeed I have turned to You, and indeed I do submit.”"
