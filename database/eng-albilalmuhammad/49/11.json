    "text": "O you who believe, do not let some people among you laugh at others, it may be that the latter are better than the former, nor let some women laugh at others, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Do not defame, or be sarcastic to each other, nor call each other by offensive nicknames. Terrible is a name of defamation to be used for one who has believed, and those who do not desist are acting wrongfully"
