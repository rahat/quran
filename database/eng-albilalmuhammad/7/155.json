    "text": "And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our meeting place. When they were seized with violent quaking he prayed, â€œO my Lord, if it had been Your will, You could have caused to perish, long before, both them and me. Would You destroy us all for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? This is no more than Your trial. By it, You cause whom You will to stray, and You lead whom You will onto the right path. You are our Protector, so forgive us and give us Your mercy, for You are the best of those who forgive"
