    "text": "To the Madyan people We sent Shu’aib, one of their own brothers. He said, “O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him. Now there has come to you guidance from your Lord, so give just measure and weight, and do not withhold from the people the things due to them. And create no chaos on the earth after it has been set in order. That will be best for you, if you have faith"
