    "text": "When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Guardian Evolver addressed him, then he said, “O my Lord, show Yourself to me that I may look upon you.” God said, “By no means can you see Me, but look upon the mountain, if it remains in its place, then will you see Me.” When his Lord manifested His glory on the mountain, He made it as particles, and Moses fainted. When he returned to consciousness he said, “Glory be to You, to You do I turn, and I am the first to believe.”"
