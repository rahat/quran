    "text": "Your Guardian Evolver is God, He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne. He draws the night over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, all governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed is God, the Lord of all the worlds"
