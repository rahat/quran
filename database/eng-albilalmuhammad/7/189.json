    "text": "It is He Who created you from a single person, and made her mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love. When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about. When she grows heavy, they both pray to God their Lord saying, “If You give us an excellent child, we promise to be grateful.”"
