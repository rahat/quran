    "text": "When Moses came back to his people displeased and grieved he said, “You have done wrong in my absence. Did you want to induce the judgment of your Lord?” He put down the tablets, seized his brother by his hair, and dragged him to himself. Aaron said, “Son of my mother, the people indeed saw me as nothing, and nearly murdered me. Do not allow the enemies to rejoice over my misfortune, nor count me among the people of sin.”"
