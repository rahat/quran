Nor on the people visiting the Sacred House, seeking the bounty and blessings of their Lord. And when you come out of pilgrim garb, you may hunt. But do not let the hatred of some people who shut you out of the Sacred Masjid, lead you to transgression. Help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in harmful deeds and hatred. And be conscious of God, Who is strict in punishment"

And forbidden is that which is sacrificed on stone, and the division by raffling with arrows, for that is impiety. This day have those who reject it given up all hope of your way of life. Yet do not fear them, but fear Me. This day have I complemented your way of life for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Al-Islam as your way of life. But if any are forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgress, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
