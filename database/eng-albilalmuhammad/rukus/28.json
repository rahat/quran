Say, “Fighting therein is a grave offense, but worse in the sight of God is to prevent access to the path of God, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Masjid, and to drive out its members.” Oppression is worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life, and in the hereafter, they will be companions of the fire and will live therein forever"
