God knows what you used to do secretly among yourselves, but He turned to you and forgave you. So associate with them now, and seek what God has ordained for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from its black thread. Then continue to fast until night. But do not be intimate with your wives while you are in retreat in the masjid. Those are limits set by God, do not come near it. God makes clear His signs to humanity, that they may become realized"
