Abraham said, “My Lord is He Who gives life and death.” He said, “I give life and death.” Abraham said, “And it is God Who causes the Sun to rise from the East, can you cause it to rise from the West?” Then he was angered, he who rejected. And God does not give guidance to those people who are wrongdoers"

He said, “How will God bring it to life after its death?” So God caused him to die for a hundred years then raised him up. He said, “How long have you been here?” He said, “A day or part of a day.” He said, “No, you have been here a hundred years. But look at your food and drink, they show no sign of age, and look at your donkey. And We will make you a sign for humanity. Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.” Once this became clear to him he said, “I know that God has power over all things.”"
