When ready, if anyone wishes to continue the ‘Umra, on to the Hajj, he must make an offering, such as he can afford. But if he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in the Sacred Masjid. And be aware of God, and know that God is strict in punishment"
