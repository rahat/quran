Only those who do not drink it will go with me, a little sip from the hand is excused.” But they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river, he and the faithful with him said, “This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.” But those who were convinced that they must meet God said, “How often, by God's will, has a small force vanquished a large one? God is with those who steadfastly persevere.”"

To Jesus the son of Mary We gave guidance and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among themselves after guidance came to them. But they were divided, some believing and others rejecting. If God had willed they would not have fought each other, but God fulfills His plan"
