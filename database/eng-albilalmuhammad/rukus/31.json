No soul will have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother should be treated unfairly because of her child, nor a father because of his child. An heir should be treated the same. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If you decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided you pay the mother what you offered on fair terms.
