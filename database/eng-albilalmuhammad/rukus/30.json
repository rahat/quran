It is not permissible for you to take back any of your gifts from your wives, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God. If you indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits set down by God, there is no blame on either of them if she negotiates with it. These are the limits established by God, so do not transgress them. If any transgress the limits prescribed by God, they are doing wrong"

But do not take them back to injure them or to take undue advantage of them. If anyone does that, he wrongs his own self. Do not treat God's signs without regard, but solemnly rehearse God's favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and the Wisdom for your instruction. And be conscious of God, and know that God is well acquainted with all things"
