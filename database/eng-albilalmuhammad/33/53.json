    "text": "O you who believe, do not enter the Prophetâ€™s houses until you are given permission to come eat, and then not so early as to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, feel free to enter, but once you have finished your meal, leave without making conversation. Such behavior annoys the Prophet. He is shy about asking you to leave, but God is not shy about telling you the truth, and when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen. That makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs, nor is it right for you to annoy God's messenger, nor should you marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in God's sight an enormity"
