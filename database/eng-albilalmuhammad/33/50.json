    "text": "O Prophet, We have made permissible to you, your wives to whom you have given their dowry, and those whom your right hand possess, out of those who God has assigned to you, and daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who migrated with you, and any believing woman who dedicates herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet wishes to wed her. This is only for you, and not for the believers at large. We know what We have appointed for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess, in order that there will be no difficulty for you, and God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
