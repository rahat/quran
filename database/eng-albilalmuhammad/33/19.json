    "text": "Who rely on you. And when danger arises, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving, like one of those who death hovers over, but when the danger has passed, they will strike you with sharp tongues, covetous of the good. Such people have no faith, so God has made their deeds of no effect, and that is easy for God"
