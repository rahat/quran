    "text": "Behold, you said to one who had received the grace of God and your favor, \"Hold on to your wife, and be conscious of God.‚Äù But you hid in your heart that which God was about to make manifest. You feared the people, but it is more fitting that you fear God. Then when Zaid divorced her following the necessary procedures, We joined her in marriage to you, in order that there may be no difficulty on the believers concerning marriage with the wives of those who you call your sons, after they had divorced them following the necessary procedures, and God's command must be fulfilled"
