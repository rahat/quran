    "text": "Except those who join a group with whom there is a treaty of peace, or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you and from fighting their own people. If God so pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. Therefore, if they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and send you peace, then God has opened no way for you to war against them"
