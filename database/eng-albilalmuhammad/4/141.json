If you gain a victory from God they say, “Were we not with you?” But if the unbelievers gain a victory they say to them, “Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?” But God will judge between you on the Day of Accountability, and never will God grant to the unbelievers a way to triumph over the believers"
