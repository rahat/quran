    "text": "If a wife fears mistreatment or neglect on her husband’s part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves. And such settlement is best, even though men’s souls are swayed by greed. But if you do good and practice self-restraint, God is well acquainted with all that you do"
