    "text": "Have you not turned your vision to those told to hold back their hands, but to instead establish prayer and pay their zakat? When the order for fighting was issued to them, behold, a section of them feared people as, or even more than, they should have feared God. They said, “Our Lord, why have you ordered us to fight? Will you not grant us respite to our natural term?” Say, “Short is the enjoyment of the present. The hereafter is best for those who do right. And never will you be dealt with unjustly in the least"
