    "text": "O you who believe, do not approach prayer with a confused mind, until you can understand all that you say. Nor in a state of ceremonial impurity, until after washing your entire body. If you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you come from offices of nature, or you have been intimate with your woman, and you find no water, then take for yourselves earth, and rub your faces and hands with it, for God removes sins and forgives again and again"
