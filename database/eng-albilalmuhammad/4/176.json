    "text": "They ask you for a legal decision. Say, God teaches concerning those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs, that if a man dies leaving a sister but no child, she will have half the inheritance. If a woman leaves no child, her brother inherits her portion. If there are two sisters, they will have two-thirds of the inheritance. If there are brothers and sisters, they share, the male having twice the share of the female. God makes this clear to you, so that you will not err, and God has knowledge of all things"
