    "text": "Of the Jews, there are some who displace words from their places and say, “We hear and we do not follow,” and “Hear what is not heard,” and “Ra’ina,” with a twist of their tongues and a slander to faith. If only they had said, “We hear and we follow,” and “Do hear,” and “Do look at us,” it would have been better for them, and more proper. But God has cursed them for their unbelief, still few from those will believe"
