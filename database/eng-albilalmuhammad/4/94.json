    "text": "O you who believe, when you go abroad in the cause of God, observe carefully, and do not say to anyone who offers you a salutation, “You are not a believer.” They covet the perishable goods of this life. But with God are profits and goods abundant. You were like them yourselves until God conferred on you His favors. Therefore, carefully observe, for God is well aware of all that you do"
