    "text": "O you who believe, stand out firmly for justice as witnesses to God, even against yourselves, your parents, or your family. And whether it is against rich or poor, and God can best protect both. Do not follow the lusts of your hearts, or you may stray, and if you distort justice or decline to do justice, indeed God is well acquainted with all that you do"
