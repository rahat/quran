    "text": "But when Our clear signs are rehearsed to them, those who do not rest their hope on their meeting with Us say, “Bring us a reading other than this, or change this.” Say, “It is not for me, of my own volition, to change it. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. If I were to ignore my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a great and dreadful day.”"
