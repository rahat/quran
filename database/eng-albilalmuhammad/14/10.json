    "text": "Their messengers said, “Is there any doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you in order that He may forgive you your sins, and give you respite for a term appointed.” They said, “You are no more than human, like us. If you wish to turn us away from the gods our parents used to worship, then bring us some clear authority.”"
