    "text": "O you who believe, be helpers of God, as Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the Disciples, “Who will be my helpers for God?” The disciples said, “We are God's helpers.” Then a group of the Children of Israel believed, and a group disbelieved. But We gave power to those who believed to be used against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed"
