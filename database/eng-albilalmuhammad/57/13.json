    "text": "One day the hypocrites, men and women, will say to the believers, “Wait for us. Let us borrow from your light.” It will be said, “Turn back behind you and seek a light.” So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein forever. Within it will be mercy inside and outside, and all throughout will be punishment"
