In what you leave, their share is a fourth, if you leave no child, but if you leave a child, they get an eighth, after payment of estate tax and debt. If the male or female whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth, but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of estate tax and debt, so that no loss is caused to anyone. This is ordained by God, and God is All Knowing, Most Understanding"
