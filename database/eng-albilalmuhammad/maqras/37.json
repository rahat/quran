If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave is enough. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave should be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, fast for two months straight, by way of repentance to God, for God has all knowledge, and all wisdom"
