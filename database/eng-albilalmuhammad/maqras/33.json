And except for these, all others are permissible, provided you pursue them with gifts from your property, desiring chastity, not lust. Seeing that you are given blessings from them, give them their dowries as prescribed. But if after a dowry is prescribed you agree to modify it, there is no blame on you, and God is All Knowing, All Wise"

But God has full knowledge of your faith. Some of you are from the others. So wed them with the permission of their family, and give them their dowries according to what is reasonable. They should be chaste, not lustful, nor should they have illicit relationships. After they are taken in wedlock, if they fall into wrong, their punishment is half of that for mature women. This is for those among you who fear doing wrong. And it is better for you to practice self-restraint, but God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
