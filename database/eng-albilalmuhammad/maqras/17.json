To Jesus the son of Mary We gave guidance and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among themselves after guidance came to them. But they were divided, some believing and others rejecting. If God had willed they would not have fought each other, but God fulfills His plan"

He said, “How long have you been here?” He said, “A day or part of a day.” He said, “No, you have been here a hundred years. But look at your food and drink, they show no sign of age, and look at your donkey. And We will make you a sign for humanity. Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.” Once this became clear to him he said, “I know that God has power over all things.”"
