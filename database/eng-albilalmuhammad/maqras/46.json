They take the words out of context. They say, “If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware.” If for anyone a trial is intended by God, you have no authority in the least for him against God. For them, it is not God's will to redeem their hearts. For them there is disgrace in the present, and in the hereafter a heavy punishment"

By its standard, the Jews have been judged by the Prophets who bowed to God's will, by the rabbis and by the doctors of law, for to them was entrusted the protection of God's book, and they were witnesses to that. Therefore, do not fear others, but fear Me, and do not sell My signs for a miserable price. If any fail to judge by what God has revealed, they are unbelievers"

If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but His plan is to challenge you with what He has given you. So strive as in a race to all virtues. The goal of you all is to God. It is He Who will show you the truth of that which you dispute"
