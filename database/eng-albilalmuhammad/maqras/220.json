But pay the unbelievers what they have given for dowries, and there will be no blame on you if you marry them on payment of their dowry to them. But do not hold on to ties to unbelieving women. Ask for what you have given as their dowries, and let the unbelievers ask for what they have given as dowries. Such is the command of God. He judges between you, and God is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom"
