    "text": "And We have set none other than angels as guardians of the fire. And We have fixed their number only as a challenge for unbelievers, in order that the people of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the believers may increase in faith, and that no doubts may be left for the people of the Book and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease, and the unbelievers may say, “What meaning does God intend by this?” So God leaves to stray whom He pleases, and guides whom He pleases, and none can know the forces of your Lord except Him. And this is no other than a warning to humanity"
