    "text": "When some trouble touches the people, they cry to their Lord, turning to Him in repentance, but when He bestows a favor upon them as from Himself, the people forget that they ever cried and prayed, and they set up rivals to God, misleading others from God's path. Say, “Enjoy your blasphemy for a little while, indeed you are of the companions of the fire.”"
