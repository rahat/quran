    "text": "Do you not see that God sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow there, produce of various colors. Then it withers. You will see it grow yellow. Then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly in this is a message of remembrance to people of understanding"
