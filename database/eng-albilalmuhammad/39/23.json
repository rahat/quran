    "text": "God has revealed the best hadith, a book consistent with itself, repeating. The skin of those who fear their Lord shivers from it. Then their skin and their hearts soften to the celebration of God's praises. Such is the guidance of God. He guides with it whom He pleases, but those who God leaves to stray, can have none to guide"
