When they arrive, its gates will be opened, and its keepers will say, “Did messengers not come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the signs of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours?” The answer will be, “True.” But the decree of punishment has been proved true against the unbelievers.”"
