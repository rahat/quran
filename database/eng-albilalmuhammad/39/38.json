    "text": "If you ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, “God.” Say, “Then do you see what you invoke besides God? Can they, if God wills some penalty for me, remove His penalty? Or if He wills some benefit for me, can they keep back His grace?” Say, “Sufficient is God for me. Those who are trusting, trust Him.”"
