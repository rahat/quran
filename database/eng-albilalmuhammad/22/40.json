    "text": "Those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right, for no reason except that they say, “Our Guardian Evolver is God.” If God did not check one group of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masjids, in which the name of God is commemorated in abundant measure. God will certainly aid those who aid Him, for indeed God is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might"
