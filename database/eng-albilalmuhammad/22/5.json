    "text": "O humanity, if you have doubt about the resurrection, consider that We created you out of dust, then out of a zygote, then out of an embryo, then out of tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, in order that We may make it manifest to you, and We cause whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then We bring you out as babies, then raise you so you may reach your age of full strength, and some of you are called to die, and some are sent back to the feeblest old age, so that they know not, after having known. And you see the earth barren and lifeless, but when We pour down rain on it, it is stirred to life, it swells, and it puts forth every kind of beautiful growth"
