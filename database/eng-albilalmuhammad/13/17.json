    "text": "He sends down water from the skies. And the channels flow, each according to its measure. But the torrent washes away foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that which they heat in the fire to make ornaments or utensils, there is a scum likewise, similarly does God reveal truth and falsehood. For the scum disappears as froth cast out, while that which is for the good of humanity remains on the earth"
