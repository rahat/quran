    "text": "If there were a Quran with which mountains could be moved, or the earth was split apart, or the dead were made to speak, this would be the one, but truly the command is with God in all things. Do the believers not know that had God so willed, He could have guided all of humanity? But never will disaster cease to seize the unbelievers for their deeds or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of God comes to pass, for indeed God will not fail in His promise"
