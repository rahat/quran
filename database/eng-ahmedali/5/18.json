    "text": "Say the Jews and the Christians: \"We are sons of God and beloved of Him.\" Say: \"Why does He punish you then for your sins? No: You are only mortals, of His creation.\" He can punish whom He please and pardon whom He will, for God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and everything will go back to Him"
