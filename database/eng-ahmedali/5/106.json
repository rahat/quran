    "text": "O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours. Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: \"We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful"
