    "text": "Be not grieved, O Apostle, by those who hasten to outrace others in denial, and say with their tongues: \"We believe,\" but do not believe in their hearts. And those of the Jews who listen to tell lies, and spy on behalf of others who do not come to you, and who distort the words (of the Torah) out of context, and say: \"If you are given (what we say is true) accept it; but if you are not given it, beware.\" You cannot intercede with God for him whom God would not show the way. These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify. For them is ignominy in this world and punishment untold in the next"
