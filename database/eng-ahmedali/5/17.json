    "text": "Verily they are unbelievers who say: \"The Messiah, son of Mary, is God.\" You ask them: \"Who could prevail against God if He had chosen to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and the rest of mankind?\" For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them. He creates what He please, for God has the power over all things"
