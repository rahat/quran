Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing"

And if the man pays the whole, it is nearer to piety. But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do"
