    "text": "Then after affliction He Sent you a drowsiness as comes after security, overwhelming some among you, and making some anxious for themselves, and made them think thoughts of pagan ignorance; and they said: \"Have we a say in any affair?\" Say: \"All affairs rest with God.\" They hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say: \"If we had a say in the affair we would not have been killed in this place.\" Tell them: \"Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest. God had to try them to bring out what they concealed in their breasts, and to bring out the secrets of their hearts, for God knows your innermost thoughts"
