    "text": "When you said to him who had been favoured by God and was favoured by you: \"Keep your wife to yourself and fear God,\" you were hiding something God was about to bring to light, for you had fear of men, though you should fear God more. And when Zaid was through with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it may not remain a sin for the faithful (to marry) the wives of their adopted sons when they are through with them. God's command is to be fulfilled"
