Ask them: \"Which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?\" Were you present at the time God issued this command?\" Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge? God does not guide the miscreants"
