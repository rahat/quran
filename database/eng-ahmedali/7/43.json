Streams of running water shall ripple at their feet, and they will say: \"We are grateful to God for guiding us here. Never would we have been guided if God had not shown us the way. The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth.\" And the cry shall resound: \"This is Paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds"
