    "text": "We divided them into twelve (different) tribes. When his people asked for water, We said to Moses: \"Strike the rock with your staff;\" and behold, twelve springs of water gushed forth, so that each of the tribes had a place of its own to drink; and We made the clouds spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quails (and said): \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you.\" But (by disobeying) they did not harm Us, they harmed themselves"
