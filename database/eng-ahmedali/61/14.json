    "text": "O you who believe, be helpers of God, as Jesus, son of Mary, had said to the disciples: \"Who will help me in the way of God?\" and they had answered: \"We are the helpers of God.\" Then a section among the children of Israel believed, but a section among them did not. So We helped those who believed against their enemies, and they prevailed over them"
