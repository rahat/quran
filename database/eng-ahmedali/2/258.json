    "text": "Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: \"My Lord is the giver of life and death,\" he replied: \"I am the giver of life and death.\" And Abraham said: \"God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West,\" and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust"
