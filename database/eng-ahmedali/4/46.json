    "text": "Some among the Jews distort the words out of context and say (in place of the right words): \"We have heard and do not obey;\" and, \"hear without hearing,\" and \"listen to us,\" twisting their tongues and reviling the faith. But if they had said: \"We have heard and obey,\" and, \"hear and regard us,\" it would have been better for them and more appropriate. But God has disgraced them for their lack of belief; and so only a few of them believe"
