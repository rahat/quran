    "text": "When you are among them, and have to lead the service of prayer, let one group stand up with you, but let them keep their arms. After they have paid their homage they should go to the rear, and let the group which has not done so yet offer their service of prayer with you, remaining cautious and armed, The infidels wish to find you neglectful of your arms and provisions, to attack you unawares. It will not be a sin if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain, or you are ill; but take full precautions. God has reserved for infidels a despicable punishment"
