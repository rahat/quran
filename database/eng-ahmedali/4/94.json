    "text": "O believers, when you go out on a journey in the way of God, be discreet and do not say to anyone who greets you in peace: \"You are not a believer.\" You desire the gain of earthly life, but there are prizes in plenty with God. You were also like him (an unbeliever) in the past, but God has been gracious to you. So be careful and discreet, for God is aware of what you do"
