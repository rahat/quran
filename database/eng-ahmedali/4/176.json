    "text": "They ask you for judgement about 'Kalalah' (a man who dies childless). Say: \"God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance.\" If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person. In ease he has two sisters then they will get two-thirds of the heritage. But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females. God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything"
