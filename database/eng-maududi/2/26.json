    "text": "Well, Allah is not ashamed to cite the similitude of a gnat or of something even more insignificant than this. As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by such similitudes?\" Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing. And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah"
