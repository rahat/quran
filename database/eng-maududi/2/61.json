    "text": "Remember: You grumbled: \"O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food.

Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand.\" By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred AllahÂ´s wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah and kill His Messengers without any just cause; that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law"
