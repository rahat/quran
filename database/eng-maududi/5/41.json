Do not be grieved on account of those who vie with one another in disbelieving: even though they be those who say with their mouths: ´We believe´ even though their hearts have no faith; or they be Jews who have their ears eagerly turned to falsehood and spy for other people who did not chance to come to you, who pervert the words of Allah, taking them out of their proper context in order to distort their meaning"
