When Abraham said, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death,\" he answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" Then Abraham said, \"Well, Allah brings the sun from the east: just bring it from the west.\" At this the disbeliever was confounded: (yet he did not believe), for Allah does not show guidance to unjust people"

He exclaimed, \"How shall Allah bring back to life this township that has become dead?\" At this Allah caused him to die and he lay dead for a hundred years. Then Allah brought him back to life and asked him, \"How long have you lain here?\" He answered. \"I might have lain here for a day or a few hours.\" Allah said, \"Nay, you have been lying here in this state for a hundred years: now, just have a look at your food and your drink; they have not become spoiled in the least.

Look, how We raise up the skeleton and set the bones (of the ass) and cover them with flesh and (put breath of life into them).\" And when the Reality became manifest to him, he said, \"I know that Allah has power over everything"

Then call them and they will come running to you; know this for certain that Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise"
