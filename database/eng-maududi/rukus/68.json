Do not draw near to the Prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying nor while you are defiled - save when you are travelling - until you have washed yourselves. If you are either ill or travelling or have satisfied a want of nature or have had contact with women and can find no water, then betake yourselves to pure earth, passing with it lightly over your face and your hands. Surely Allah is All-Relenting, All-Forgiving"

They say: ´We have heard and we disobey´ (sami´na wa ´asayna), ´Do hear us, may you turn dumb´ (isma´ ghayr musma´) and ´Hearken to us´ (ra´ina). It would indeed have been better for them and more upright if they had said: ´We have heard and we obey´ (sami´na wa ata´na) and: ´Do listen to us, and look at us (with kindness)´ (wa isma´ wa unzurna). But Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief. Scarcely do they believe"
