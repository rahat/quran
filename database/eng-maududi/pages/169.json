Could you not patiently wait for the decree of your Lord?´ And he threw down the Tablets [of the Law] and took hold of his brother´s head, dragging him to himself. Aaron said: ´My mother´s son, the people overpowered me and almost killed me. So let not my enemies gloat over me, and do not number me among the wrong-doing folk.´"
