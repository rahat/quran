They say: ´We have heard and we disobey´ (sami´na wa ´asayna), ´Do hear us, may you turn dumb´ (isma´ ghayr musma´) and ´Hearken to us´ (ra´ina). It would indeed have been better for them and more upright if they had said: ´We have heard and we obey´ (sami´na wa ata´na) and: ´Do listen to us, and look at us (with kindness)´ (wa isma´ wa unzurna). But Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief. Scarcely do they believe"
