Their fruits will so resemble the fruits on the Earth that every time they will be provided with fruits, they will say, \"Such fruits were provided to us before on the Earth. \" And there will be pure spouses for them and therein they will live for ever"

As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by such similitudes?\" Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing. And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah"
