    "text": "Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken besides Him protectors, those who have no power to benefit or harm themselves?” Say, “Can the blind person be equal to the seeing, or can the darkness be equal to the light?” Or do they ascribe to Allah partners who created the like of His creation, so they are confused between two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Subjugator.”"
