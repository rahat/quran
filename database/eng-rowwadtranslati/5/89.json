    "text": "Allah will not hold you accountable for your unintentional oaths, but He will hold you accountable for your deliberate oaths. The expiation thereof is to feed ten needy people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to emancipate a slave. However, if someone cannot afford it, then he must fast for three days. That is the expiation for breaking your oaths. But be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may be grateful"
