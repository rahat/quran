    "text": "O you who believe, do not violate the sanctity of the rituals of Allah, nor of the sacred month, nor the sacrificial animals, nor the garlands, nor those [pilgrims] proceeding to the Sacred House seeking their Lordâ€™s grace and pleasure. When your pilgrimage has ended, you may hunt. However, do not let the hatred of a people who barred you from the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment"
