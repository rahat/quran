    "text": "O you who believe, when death approaches one of you, call upon two just Muslim men as witnesses when you make a bequest, or two non-Muslims if you are afflicted with death while you are traveling. But if you have some doubt, keep them both after prayer and let them swear by Allah, “We will not trade our testimony for any price, even in favor of a close relative, nor will we conceal the testimony enjoined by Allah, for then we would surely be among the sinners.”"
