    "text": "O Messenger, do not grieve for those who rush to disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe”, but their hearts have no faith, nor those Jews who eagerly listen to falsehood and to those who have not yet come to you. They distort the words [of Allah] out of their context saying, “If you are given this [ruling] accept it, but if you are not given, then beware.” Whoever Allah wills to be misguided, there is nothing you can do to avail him against Allah. They are those whose hearts Allah did not will to purify. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they will suffer a great punishment"
