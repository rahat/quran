    "text": "Today all good things have been made lawful to you. As the food of the people of the Book is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them. And [it is lawful to marry] chaste believing women and chaste women from among those who were given the Book before you, provided that you give them their dowries in honest wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as secret lovers. Whoever rejects the faith, all his efforts will be worthless and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers"
