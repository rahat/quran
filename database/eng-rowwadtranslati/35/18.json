    "text": "No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. If a heavily-laden soul calls for help to bear its burden, nothing of it will be carried, even if he is a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and establish prayer. Whoever purifies himself, he only does so for his own benefit. To Allah is the final return"
