That is more likely that they will be content and not distressed, and that they will be satisfied with what you give them all. Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing"

But if you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, then disperse, without lingering for conversation. Such [behavior] causes annoyance to the Prophet; he is too shy to express it to you, but Allah is not shy of [telling] the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. It is not lawful for you to cause annoyance to Allahâ€™s Messenger, or to ever marry his wives after him, for that is indeed an enormous sin before Allah"
