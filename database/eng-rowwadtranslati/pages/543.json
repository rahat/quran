No secret consultation takes place between three, but He is their fourth, or between five, but He is their sixth, or between fewer or more than that, but He is with them wherever they may be. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything"

When they come to you, they greet you other than the way Allah greets you, and they say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Sufficient is Hell for them; they will enter it. What a terrible destination"
