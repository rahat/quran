They declare a month lawful in one year and sacred the next year, in order to match the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, thus making lawful what Allah has made forbidden; their evil deeds have been made appealing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people"

And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
