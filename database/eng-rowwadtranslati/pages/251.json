But those whom they supplicate besides Him do not respond to them in any way, except like one who stretches out his hands for water to reach his mouth, but it will never reach it. The supplication of the disbelievers is all in vain"

Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Subjugator.”"

This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood: as for the residue, it is then cast away, but that which benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth comparisons"

As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess all that is on earth and the likes thereof, they would surely offer it to ransom themselves; they will have the worst reckoning, and their abode will be Hell. What a terrible resting place"
