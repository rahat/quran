I taught you writing, wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. You made something from clay in the shape of a bird by My permission, and breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission. You healed the born-blind and lepers by My permission, and you brought the dead to life by My permission. I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear signs, but the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but clear magic.”"
