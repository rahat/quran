    "text": "those who have been driven out of their homes for no reason other than they say, “Our Lord is Allah.” If Allah were not to repel some people by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques wherein the name of Allah is often mentioned, would surely have been demolished. Allah surely helps those who stand up for His cause. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty"
