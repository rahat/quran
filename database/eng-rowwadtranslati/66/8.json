    "text": "O you who believe, turn to Allah in sincere repentance. It may be that your Lord will absolve you of your bad deeds and admit you to gardens under which rivers flow, on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will stream ahead of them and on their right. They will say, “Our Lord, complete our light for us and forgive us, for You are Most Capable of all things.”"
