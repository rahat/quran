    "text": "And [remember, O Prophet] when you were saying to the one who was favored by Allah and favored by you, “Keep your wife and fear Allah.” You were concealing in your heart what Allah was going to reveal, and you were fearing people, while it was more fitting that you should fear Allah. When Zayd no longer had desire for her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no restraint for the believers in marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have desire for them. And Allah’s decree is bound to be fulfilled"
