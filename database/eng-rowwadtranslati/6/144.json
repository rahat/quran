    "text": "Likewise, a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you present when Allah gave you this commandment?” So who does greater wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah in order to mislead people without knowledge? Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people"
