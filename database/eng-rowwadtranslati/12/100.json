    "text": "He took his parents to the throne, and they all fell down to him in prostration before him. He said, “O my father, this is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He has been kind to me when He freed me from prison and brought you all here from the wilderness, after Satan caused a rift between me and my brothers. My Lord is gracious to whom He wills. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”"
