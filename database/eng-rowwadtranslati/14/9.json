    "text": "Have there not come to you the stories of those who came before you – the people of Noah, ‘Ād and Thamūd, and those who came after them? No one knows them except Allah. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they shoved their hands into their mouths and said, “We disbelieve in what you are sent with, and we surely doubt what you are calling us to.”"
