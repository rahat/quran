    "text": "O you who believe, be supporters of Allah’s cause, as Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples, “Who will be my supporters for Allah’s cause?” The disciples said, “We are the supporters for Allah’s cause.” Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and another disbelieved. We then supported those who believed against their enemies, so they prevailed"
