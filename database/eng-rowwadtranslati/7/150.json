    "text": "When Moses returned to his people, furious and grieved, he said, “What an evil thing you did in my absence! Did you seek to hasten the command of your Lord?” He threw the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, “O son of my mother, the people overpowered me and were about to kill me. Do not make my enemies rejoice over me, nor count me among the people of wrongdoing.”"
