    "text": "Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with nations of jinn and humans who have passed on before you.” Every time a nation enters, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord, they have led us astray, so give them a double punishment of the Fire.” He will say, “Each will have a double punishment, but you do not know.”"
