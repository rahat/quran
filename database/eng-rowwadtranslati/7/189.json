    "text": "It is He Who created you from a single soul, and from it He made its spouse, so that he may find comfort in her. When he covered her, she conceived a light burden carrying it with ease. Then when she grew heavy, they called upon Allah, their Lord, “If you give us a healthy child, we will certainly be grateful.”"
