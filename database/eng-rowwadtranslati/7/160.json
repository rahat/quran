    "text": "We divided them into twelve tribes, each as a community, and We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” There gushed forth from it twelve springs; each tribe knew the place of its drinking. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They did not wrong Us, but it was themselves that they wronged"
