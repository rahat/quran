Your wives’ share is one-fourth of your estate, if you leave no child, but if you leave a child, they get one-eighth, after settling the bequests or debts. If a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor offspring, but has a brother or a sister, each one gets one-sixth; but if they are more than two, they share in one-third, after settling the bequests or debts, without causing harm to the heirs. This is an instruction from Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing"
