    "text": "There is no blame on a blind person, nor on the lame, nor on the sick, nor on yourselves if you eat from your houses or from your fathers’ houses or your mothers’ houses or your brothers’ houses or your sisters’ houses or your paternal uncles’ houses, or your paternal aunts’ houses or your maternal uncles’ houses or your maternal aunts’ houses or from the houses the keys of which are in your possession, or your friends’ houses. There is no blame on you if you eat together or separately. But when you enter houses, greet one another with greetings of peace from Allah, which is blessed and delightful. This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you, so that you may understand"
