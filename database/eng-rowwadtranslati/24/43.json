    "text": "Do you not see that Allah drives the clouds, then gathers them together, then turns them into a heap, then you see raindrops coming out from their midst? He sends down hail from mountains [of clouds] in the sky, raining it down upon whoever He wills and turning it away from whoever He wills. The flash of its lightning almost takes away eyesight"
