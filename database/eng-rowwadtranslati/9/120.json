    "text": "It was not for the people of Madinah and the Bedouins around them to stay behind the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives to his. That is because whenever they suffer any thirst, weariness or hunger in the cause of Allah, or tread a place which enrages the disbelievers, or inflict any loss upon an enemy, a righteous deed is recorded for them. Allah does not allow the reward of those who do good to go to waste"
