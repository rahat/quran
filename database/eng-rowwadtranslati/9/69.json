    "text": "[O hypocrites, you are] like those who came before you, who were more powerful than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, and you too have enjoyed your share just as those who came before you enjoyed their share; and you have indulged in idle talk just as they did. Such are those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers"
