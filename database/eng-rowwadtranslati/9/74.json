    "text": "They swear by Allah that they said nothing [blasphemous], while they indeed uttered a word of blasphemy, and disbelieved after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not achieve. They are spiteful [against believers] for no reason except that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them out of His bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have on earth no protector or helper"
