The likeness of His light is that of a niche in which is a lamp; the lamp is in a glass; the glass is like a shining star â€“ it is lit by [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, which is neither of the east nor of the west. Its oil would almost glow, even without being touched by fire. Light upon light; Allah guides to His light whom He wills. Allah sets forth comparisons for people, and Allah is All-Knowing of everything"
