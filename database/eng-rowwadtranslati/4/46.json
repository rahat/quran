    "text": "Among the Jews are those who distort the words taking them out of the context, and say, “We hear and disobey,” and “Hear! May you never hear,” and “Rā‘ina” [hearken to us] – twisting their tongues and insulting the religion. If they had said, “We hear and obey,” and “Hear,” and “Wait for us,” it would have been better for them and more proper. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so only a few of them will believe"
