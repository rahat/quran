    "text": "Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they spend of their wealth. Therefore the righteous women are obedient, and protect what Allah has entrusted them with in [their husbandâ€™s] absence. As for those women on whose part you fear rebellion, [first] admonish them, [next] forsake them in bed, and [last] hit them [gently]. Then if they obey you, do not take further action against them. Indeed, Allah is Most High, All-Great"
