    "text": "They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling concerning the one leaving neither descendant nor ascendant as heir. If he dies leaving no child but a sister, she will get one half of the inheritance. Likewise, he will inherit her if she dies leaving behind no descendant. If they are two sisters, they will share two thirds of the inheritance. Should there be both male and female siblings, then the share of a male is equal to that of two females.” Allah explains it clearly so that you do not fall into error. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything"
