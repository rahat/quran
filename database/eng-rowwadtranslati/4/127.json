    "text": "They ask you [O Prophet] concerning women. Say, “It is Allah Who gives you a ruling concerning them. It has been recited to you in the Book concerning orphan girls whom you deprive of their prescribed rights [of dowry and inheritance], yet you desire to marry them, and concerning helpless children, and that you should treat orphans with justice. Whatever good you do, Allah is All-Knowing of it.”"
