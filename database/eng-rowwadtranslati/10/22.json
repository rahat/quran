    "text": "It is He Who enables you to travel through the land and sea, until when you are in the ships and they sail with those on board and rejoicing in a favorable wind, then suddenly a stormy wind comes, with waves crashing into them on all sides, and they feel that there is no escape. Then they cry out to Allah with sincere devotion to Him, “If You save us from this, we will surely be among those who are grateful.”"
