    "text": "Indeed, you have a good example in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “We dissociate ourselves from you and whatever you worship besides Allah. We renounce you, and the enmity and hatred have arisen between us and you forever until you believe in Allah alone”, except for Abraham when he said to his father, “I will seek forgiveness for you, but I cannot protect you from Allah in the least.” “Our Lord, in You we put our trust and to You we turn, and to You is the final return.”"
