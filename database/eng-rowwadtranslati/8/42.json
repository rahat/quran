If you had made prior arrangements to encounter, you would have failed to keep that appointment. But [it happened] so that Allah might accomplish what had already been decreed, and so that those who chose to perish would perish after seeing clear evidence, and those who chose to survive would survive after seeing clear evidence. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
