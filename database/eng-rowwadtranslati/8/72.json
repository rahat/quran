    "text": "Those who believed, migrated, and fought with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah, and those who provided [migrants] with shelter and help â€“ they are allies of one another. As for those who believed but did not migrate, you have no obligation to protect them until they migrate. But if they seek your help in religion, it is your obligation to help, except against people with whom you have a treaty. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do"
