    "text": "And Complete Hajj and ‘Umrah for Allah. But if you are prevented, then [offer] whatever sacrificial animal is available, and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its place of sacrifice. But if anyone among you is sick or has an ailment of the scalp [and had his head shaved], then he must compensate by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering. And when you are safe, then if anyone takes a break between ‘Umrah and Hajj, he must offer a sacrifice of whatever animal is available. However, if he cannot afford an offering, he should fast for three days during Hajj and seven days upon his return [home], making ten days in all. This is for those who are not of the residents of the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution"
