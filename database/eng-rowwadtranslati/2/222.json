    "text": "They ask you about menstruation. Say: â€œIt is impurity; so stay away from women during menstruation and do not have intercourse with them until they become pure. When they are cleansed, then have intimacy with them as Allah has commanded you. Allah loves those who frequently repent and He loves those who purify themselves"
