    "text": "O you who believe, do not nullify your charities with reminders and hurtful words, like the one who spends his wealth to show off before people, but does not believe in Allah or the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock upon which is dust, when it is hit by a heavy rain it is left bare. They will gain no reward from their deeds, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people"
