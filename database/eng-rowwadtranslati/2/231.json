    "text": "When you divorce women and they have completed their waiting period, either retain them with fairness or release them with fairness. Do not retain them in order to harm them, exceeding the limits. Whoever does this, he has wronged himself. Do not make mockery of Allah’s verses, and remember Allah’s grace upon you and what He has sent down to you of the Book and the Wisdom, to exhort you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Knowing of everything"
