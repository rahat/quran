    "text": "Those messengers: We favored some over others. There are some to whom Allah spoke, and some He raised high in rank. To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah had willed, those who came after them would not have fought one another after receiving clear signs. But they differed â€“ some believed and some disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another, but Allah does what He wills"
