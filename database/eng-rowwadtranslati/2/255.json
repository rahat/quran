    "text": "Allah: none has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Who is there that can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what was before them and what will be after them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge, except what He wills. His KursÄ« [footstool] extends over the heavens and earth, and safeguarding of both does not weary Him, for He is the Most High, Most Great"
