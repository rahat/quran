    "text": "O you who believe, legal retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder – a free for a free, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if one is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then a fair ransom of blood-money should be set and paid in best way. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses the limits afterwards, will have a painful punishment"
