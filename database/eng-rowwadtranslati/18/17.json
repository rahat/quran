    "text": "You would have seen the sun when it rose, it would incline away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it would turn away from them to the left, while they were in its open space. That was one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whoever He causes to stray, you will never find for him a protecting guide"
