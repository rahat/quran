One of them said, “How long have you been here?” They said, “We have been here for a day or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long have you been here. Send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him see who has the most pure food and bring some provision from it. And be cautious and let no one know about you"
