    "text": "Say, “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills may believe, and whoever wills may disbelieve.” We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire which will encompass them like the walls. If they cry for relief, they will be relieved with water like boiling oil that will scald the faces. What a terrible drink, and what a terrible resting place"
