    "text": "God does not place two hearts in any person’s chest. Nor does He regard your wives as ˹unlawful for you like˺ your real mothers, ˹even˺ if you say they are. Nor does He regard your adopted children as your real children. These are only your baseless assertions. But God declares the truth, and He ˹alone˺ guides to the ˹Right˺ Way"
