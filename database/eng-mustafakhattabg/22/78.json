    "text": "Strive for ˹the cause of˺ God in the way He deserves, for ˹it is˺ He ˹Who˺ has chosen you, and laid upon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham. ˹It is God˺ Who named you ‘the ones who submit’ ˹in the˺ earlier ˹Scriptures˺ and in this ˹Quran˺, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over humanity. So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to God. He ˹alone˺ is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper"
