    "text": "We would surely be fabricating a lie against God if we were to return to your faith after God has saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of God, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. In God we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.”"
