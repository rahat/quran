    "text": "You will never find a people who ˹truly˺ believe in God and the Last Day loyal to those who defy God and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, children, siblings, or extended family. For those ˹believers˺, God has instilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him. He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of God. Indeed, God’s party is bound to succeed"
