They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by God, violating the very months God has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And God does not guide the disbelieving people"

While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion, “Do not worry; God is certainly with us.” So God sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of God is supreme. And God is Almighty, All-Wise"
