And whoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay blood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if the victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be freed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a means of repentance to God. And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"

And do not say to those who offer you ˹greetings of˺ peace, “You are no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain. Instead, God has infinite bounties ˹in store˺. You were initially like them then God blessed you ˹with Islam˺. So be sure! Indeed, God is All-Aware of what you do"
