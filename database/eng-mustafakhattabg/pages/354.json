And if any of those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession desires a deed of emancipation, make it possible for them, if you find goodness in them. And give them some of God’s wealth which He has granted you. Do not force your ˹slave˺ girls into prostitution for your own worldly gains while they wish to remain chaste. And if someone coerces them, then after such a coercion God is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful ˹to them˺"

Light upon light! God guides whoever He wills to His light. And God sets forth parables for humanity. For God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things"
