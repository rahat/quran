You see them bowing and prostrating ˹in prayer˺, seeking God’s bounty and pleasure. The sign ˹of brightness can be seen˺ on their faces from the trace of prostrating ˹in prayer˺. This is their description in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its ˹tiny˺ branches, making it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters—in this way God makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers. To those of them who believe and do good, God has promised forgiveness and a great reward"
