The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain"

Or can darkness and light be equal?” Or have they associated with God partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.”"

They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest"
