And if you are in a state of ˹full˺ impurity, then take a full bath. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth by wiping your faces and hands. It is not God’s Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful"
