And We sent down iron with its great might, benefits for humanity, and means for God to prove who ˹is willing to˺ stand up for Him and His messengers without seeing Him. Surely God is All-Powerful, Almighty"

As for monasticism, they made it up—We never ordained it for them—only seeking to please God, yet they did not ˹even˺ observe it strictly. So We rewarded those of them who were faithful. But most of them are rebellious"
