A lesson is set forth, so listen to it ˹carefully˺: those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides God can never create ˹so much as˺ a fly, even if they ˹all˺ were to come together for that. And if a fly were to snatch anything away from them, they cannot ˹even˺ retrieve it from the fly. How powerless are those who invoke and those invoked"

So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to God. He ˹alone˺ is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper"
