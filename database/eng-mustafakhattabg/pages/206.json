They knew there was no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely God ˹alone˺ is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful"

That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of God; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely God never discounts the reward of the good-doers"
