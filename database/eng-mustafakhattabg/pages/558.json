And fear God, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct. These are the limits set by God. And whoever transgresses God’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know, perhaps God will bring about a change ˹of heart˺ later"

This is enjoined on whoever has faith in God and the Last Day. And whoever is mindful of God, He will make a way out for them"
