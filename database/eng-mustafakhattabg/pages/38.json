God knows that you are considering them ˹for marriage˺. But do not make a secret commitment with them—you can only show interest in them appropriately. Do not commit to the bond of marriage until the waiting period expires. Know that God is aware of what is in your hearts, so beware of Him. And know that God is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing"
