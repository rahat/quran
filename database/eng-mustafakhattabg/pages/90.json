Then once the order came to fight, a group of them feared those ˹hostile˺ people as God should be feared—or even more. They said, “Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? If only You had delayed ˹the order for˺ us for a little while!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The enjoyment of this world is so little, whereas the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of God˺. And none of you will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone"

They can hardly comprehend anything"
