For those ˹believers˺, God has instilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him. He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of God. Indeed, God’s party is bound to succeed"

And they thought their strongholds would put them out of God’s reach. But ˹the decree of˺ God came upon them from where they never expected. And He cast horror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson ˹from this˺, O people of insight"
