Show me how you give life to the dead.” God responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham replied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” God said, “Then bring four birds, train them to come to you, ˹then cut them into pieces,˺ and scatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you in haste. And ˹so you will˺ know that God is Almighty, All-Wise.”"

Do not waste your charity with reminders ˹of your generosity˺ or hurtful words, like those who donate their wealth just to show off and do not believe in God or the Last Day. Their example is that of a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil hit by a strong rain—leaving it just a bare stone. Such people are unable to preserve the reward of their charity. God does not guide ˹such˺ disbelieving people"
