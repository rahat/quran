    "text": "And ˹on Judgment Day˺ God will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides God?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen"
