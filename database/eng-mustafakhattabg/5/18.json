    "text": "The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of God and His most beloved!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To God ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return.”"
