Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has the power to prevent God if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and everyone in the world all together?” To God ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wills. And God is Most Capable of everything"
