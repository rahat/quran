He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy. So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking God’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of God. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to God a good loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with God far better and more rewarding. And seek God’s forgiveness. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
