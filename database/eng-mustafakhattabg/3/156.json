    "text": "O believers! Do not be like the unfaithful who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” God makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is God who gives life and causes death. And God is All-Seeing of what you do"
