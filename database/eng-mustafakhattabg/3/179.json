    "text": "God would not leave the believers in the condition you were in, until He distinguished the good from the evil ˹among you˺. Nor would God ˹directly˺ reveal to you the unseen, but He chooses whoever He wills as a messenger. So believe in God and His messengers. And if you are faithful and mindful ˹of God˺, you will receive a great reward"
