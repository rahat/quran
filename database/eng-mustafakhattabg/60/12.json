When the believing women come to you, pledging to you that they will neither associate anything with God ˹in worship˺, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor falsely attribute ˹illegitimate˺ children to their husbands, nor disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge, and ask God to forgive them. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
