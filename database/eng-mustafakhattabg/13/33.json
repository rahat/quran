    "text": "Is ˹there any equal to˺ the Vigilant One Who knows what every soul commits? Yet the pagans have associated others with God ˹in worship˺. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Name them! Or do you ˹mean to˺ inform Him of something He does not know on the earth? Or are these ˹gods˺ just empty words?” In fact, the disbelievers’ falsehood has been made so appealing to them that they have been turned away from the Path. And whoever God leaves to stray will be left with no guide"
