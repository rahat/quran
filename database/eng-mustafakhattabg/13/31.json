    "text": "If there were a recitation that could cause mountains to move, or the earth to split, or the dead to speak, ˹it would have been this Quran˺. But all matters are by God’s Will. Have the believers not yet realized that had God willed, He could have guided all of humanity? And disasters will continue to afflict the disbelievers or strike close to their homes for their misdeeds, until God’s promise comes to pass. Surely God never fails in His promise"
