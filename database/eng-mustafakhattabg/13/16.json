    "text": "Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “God!” Ask ˹them˺, “Why ˹then˺ have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and the sighted be equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?” Or have they associated with God partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.”"
