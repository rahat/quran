    "text": "For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by God’s command. Indeed, God would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is God’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him"
