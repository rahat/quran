    "text": "Divorced women must wait three monthly cycles ˹before they can re-marry˺. It is not lawful for them to conceal what God has created in their wombs, if they ˹truly˺ believe in God and the Last Day. And their husbands reserve the right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men equitably, although men have a degree ˹of responsibility˺ above them. And God is Almighty, All-Wise"
