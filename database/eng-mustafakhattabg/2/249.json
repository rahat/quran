    "text": "When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “God will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet God reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of God! And God is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.”"
