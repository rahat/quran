    "text": "Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his wife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace. It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of God. So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of God, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These are the limits set by God, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of God, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers"
