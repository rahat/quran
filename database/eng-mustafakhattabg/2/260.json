Show me how you give life to the dead.” God responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham replied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” God said, “Then bring four birds, train them to come to you, ˹then cut them into pieces,˺ and scatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you in haste. And ˹so you will˺ know that God is Almighty, All-Wise.”"
