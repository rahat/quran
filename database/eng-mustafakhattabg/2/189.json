    "text": "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the phases of the moon. Say, “They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” Righteousness is not in entering your houses from the back doors. Rather, righteousness is to be mindful ˹of God˺. So enter your homes through their ˹proper˺ doors, and be mindful of God so you may be successful"
