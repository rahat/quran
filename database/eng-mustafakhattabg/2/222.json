    "text": "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about menstruation. Say, “Beware of its harm! So keep away, and do not have intercourse with your wives during their monthly cycles until they are purified. When they purify themselves, then you may approach them in the manner specified by God. Surely God loves those who always turn to Him in repentance and those who purify themselves.”"
