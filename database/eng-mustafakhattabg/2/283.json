    "text": "If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken. If you trust one another, then ˹there is no need for a security, but˺ the debtor should honour this trust ˹by repaying the debt˺—and let them fear God, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And God ˹fully˺ knows what you do"
