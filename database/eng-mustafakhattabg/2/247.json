    "text": "Their prophet told them, “God has appointed Saul to be your king.” They protested, “How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving of kingship than he, and he has not been blessed with vast riches?” He replied, “God has chosen him over you and blessed him with knowledge and stature. God grants kingship to whoever He wills. And God is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.”"
