    "text": "Humanity had once been one community ˹of believers before they lost faith˺. Then God raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as warners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people regarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very people who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of jealousy. Then God, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth regarding those disputes. And God guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path"
