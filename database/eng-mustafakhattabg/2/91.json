    "text": "When it is said to them: “Believe in what God has revealed,” they reply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Why then did you kill God’s prophets before, if you are ˹truly˺ believers?”"
