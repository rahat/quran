Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever God allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against God. It is not God’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter"
