If this person leaves behind two sisters, they together will inherit two-thirds of the estate. But if the deceased leaves male and female siblings, a male’s share will be equal to that of two females. God makes ˹this˺ clear to you so you do not go astray. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things"
