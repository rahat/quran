    "text": "He created you ˹all˺ from a single soul, then from it He made its mate. And He produced for you four pairs of cattle. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers ˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness. That is God—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away"
