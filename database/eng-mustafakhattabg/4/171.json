    "text": "O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say nothing about God except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of God and the fulfilment of His Word through Mary and a spirit ˹created by a command˺ from Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not say, “Trinity.” Stop!—for your own good. God is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And God is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs"
