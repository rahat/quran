    "text": "O believers! When you struggle in the cause of God, be sure of who you fight. And do not say to those who offer you ˹greetings of˺ peace, “You are no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain. Instead, God has infinite bounties ˹in store˺. You were initially like them then God blessed you ˹with Islam˺. So be sure! Indeed, God is All-Aware of what you do"
