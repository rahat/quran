    "text": "˹The hypocrites are˺ those who wait to see what happens to you. So if God grants you victory, they say ˹to you˺, “Were we not on your side?” But if the disbelievers have a share ˹of victory˺, they say ˹to them˺, “Did we not have the advantage over you, yet we protected you from the believers?” God will judge between ˹all of˺ you on the Day of Judgment. And God will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers"
