    "text": "They ask you ˹for a ruling, O Prophet˺. Say, “God gives you a ruling regarding those who die without children or parents.” If a man dies childless and leaves behind a sister, she will inherit one-half of his estate, whereas her brother will inherit all of her estate if she dies childless. If this person leaves behind two sisters, they together will inherit two-thirds of the estate. But if the deceased leaves male and female siblings, a male’s share will be equal to that of two females. God makes ˹this˺ clear to you so you do not go astray. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things"
