    "text": "It was not ˹proper˺ for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of God or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of God; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely God never discounts the reward of the good-doers"
