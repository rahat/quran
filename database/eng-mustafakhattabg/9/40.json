    "text": "˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for God did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion, “Do not worry; God is certainly with us.” So God sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of God is supreme. And God is Almighty, All-Wise"
