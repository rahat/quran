    "text": "And ˹God has also turned in mercy to˺ the three who had remained behind, ˹whose guilt distressed them˺ until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely God ˹alone˺ is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful"
