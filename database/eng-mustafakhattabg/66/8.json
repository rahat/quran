    "text": "O believers! Turn to God in sincere repentance, so your Lord may absolve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens, under which rivers flow, on the Day God will not disgrace the Prophet or the believers with him. Their light will shine ahead of them and on their right. They will say, “Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us. ˹For˺ You are truly Most Capable of everything.”"
