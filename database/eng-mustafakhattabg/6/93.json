    "text": "Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against God or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of God’s revelations!”? If you ˹O Prophet˺ could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands ˹saying˺, “Give up your souls! Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for telling lies about God and for being arrogant towards His revelations!”"
