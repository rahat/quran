    "text": "They ask you (Muhammad) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: “Lawful are made to you pure good things. What you have taught to hunting animals (beasts and birds of prey) train them for hunting; you teach them what (knowledge) Allah has taught you. So you may eat what they catch for you, but invoke the name of Allah on it, and fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Swift in reckoning.”"
