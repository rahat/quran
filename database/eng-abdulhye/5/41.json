    "text": "O Messenger (Muhammad)! Let not grieve you those who race each other into disbelief, of those who say: “We believe” with their mouths but their hearts don’t believe. Of those who have become Jews are listeners to falsehood, listeners to other people who have not come to you. They change the words from their context; they say: “If you are given this, you take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!” Whom Allah wills, falls into error, and you will never be able to do anything for him against Allah. Those are the ones whom Allah does not want to purify their hearts; for them there is disgrace in this world, and for them there is a great punishment in the Hereafter"
