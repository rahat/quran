    "text": "O you who believe! Don’t violate (the sanctity of the) symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals (brought for sacrifice), nor of the garlanded (animals marked for security), nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah) seeking the Bounty of their Lord and good pleasure. When you finish the Ihram (Pilgrimage), you may hunt. Let not the hatred of some people, who once stopped you from the Sacred Masjid (at Makkah), lead you to transgress. You help one another in righteousness and piety; and don’t help one another in sin and transgression. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Severe in punishment"
