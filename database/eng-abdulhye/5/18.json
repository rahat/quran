    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say: “We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.” Say: “Why then He punishes you for your sins? But you are human being from those He created, He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and to Him is the return.”"
