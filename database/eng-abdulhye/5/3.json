    "text": "Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead animal’s meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been slaughtered as a sacrifice to other than Allah, (killed by) strangling and by a violent blow, and by a headlong fall, and by the goring of horns, and that devoured (partly eaten) by a beast except that slaughtered by you (before its death), and what slaughtered on altars (elevated places for sacrifice), and that you seek knowledge of your fate by dividing arrows. All these are sins (disobedience of Allah). This Day, those who have given up all hope, disbelieved of your religion. So you don’t fear them, but fear Me. This Day, I have perfected for you your religion, completed upon you My Favor, and has approved for you Islam as your religion. Whoever is forced by hunger, not inclined to sin (not eaten forbidden food), then surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
