Whoever among you turns back from religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, strict towards the disbelievers, strive in the Way of Allah, and will not fear blame of a critic. That is the Grace of Allah, He grants whom He wills. Allah is All-Sufficient in resources, All-Knower"
