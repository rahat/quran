Remember My Favor to you and to your mother when I strengthened you with spirit of the holy (Gabriel), you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you the book and the wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you made from clay like the figure of a bird by My permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission, you healed the born-blind, and the lepers by My permission, when you raised the dead by My permission, when I restrained children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear proofs; and those who disbelieved among them said: This is nothing but clear magic.”"
