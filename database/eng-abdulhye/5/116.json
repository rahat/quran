Did you say to people: ‘Take me and my mother as 2 who are worthy of worship besides Allah?”’ Jesus will say: “Glory is to You! It was not for me that I say what I had no right to say. Had I said it, then surely You would have known it. You know what is in my soul and I don’t know what is in Your; truly, You know all of the hidden things"
