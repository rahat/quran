    "text": "O you who believe! Take witness between you when any of you approaches the death while making a will with 2 just men among you, or 2 others from among other than you if you are traveling through the land and calamity of the death befalls you. You detain them both after the prayer, they swear by Allah if you doubt them saying: “We will not sell it for a price even if he is a near relative. We shall not conceal the Testimony of Allah, then indeed we will be among the sinners.”"
