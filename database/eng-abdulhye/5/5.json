    "text": "This Day made lawful to you are pure good things. Food of those who have been given the Scripture is lawful to you and your food is lawful to them. (Lawful to marry) chaste women from the believing women and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their bridal due (given by husband to his wife at the time of marriage) desiring chastity not lewdness (illegal sex), nor taking them as secret companions (girl friends). Whosoever disbelieves in faith, their work will go to waste, and they will be in the Hereafter among the losers"
