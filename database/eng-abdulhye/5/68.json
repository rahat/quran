You are not on anything (guided) till you observe the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord (the Qur’an).” Certainly this revelation (the Qur’an) which has come to you from your Lord will increase in many of them in rebellion and disbelief. So don’t grieve over the disbelievers"
