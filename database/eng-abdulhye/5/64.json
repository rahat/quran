    "text": "The Jews say: “Hands of Allah is tied up.” Their own hands are tied up and they are cursed for what they have said. But His hands are outspread. He spends Bounty as He wills. Surely, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord increases their rebellion and disbelief. We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindled fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they always strive on earth to spread mischief. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers"
