    "text": "Surely Allah took a covenant from the children of Israel, and We appointed among them 12 leaders. And Allah said: “Certainly I am with you if you establish the prayer, you pay obligatory charity, you believe in My Messengers, you assist them, and you lend to Allah a good loan (spend in charity). Surely, I will wipe out from you your evil deeds, and will surely admit you to gardens under them the rivers flow (in Paradise). But whoever disbelieved after this among you, indeed he has gone astray from Right Way.”"
