    "text": "Allah will not call you to account for unintentional things in your oaths. But He will call you to account for earnestly sworn in oaths. The penalty (for a broken oath) is feeding 10 needy people of average of what you feed your families; or clothing them; or freeing a captive. But whoever can not afford, then fasting for 3 days. That is expiation of your oaths when you have sworn. But keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His Verses so that you may give thanks"
