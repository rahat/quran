    "text": "Those Messengers! We preferred some of them over others. To some of them, Allah spoke (directly), and He raised some of them in degrees (of honor). We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and supported him with Holy Spirit (angel Gabriel). If Allah willed, the people who received the clear Verses (of Allah) would not have fought against each other. But they differed, some of them believed, and some of them disbelieved. If Allah willed, they would not have fought one another, but Allah does what He wills"
