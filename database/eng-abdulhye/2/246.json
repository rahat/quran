    "text": "Have you not thought about the group of the children of Israel after Moses? When they said to a prophet of theirs: \"Appoint for us a king and we will fight in the way of Allah.\" He said: \"Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting is prescribed for you?‚Äù They said: \"Why should we not fight in the way of Allah while we along with our children have been driven out from our homes?\" But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned back except a few of them. Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers"
