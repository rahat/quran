    "text": "It is the month of Ramadan in which the Qurâ€™an was revealed, a guidance for mankind with clear proofs, and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you witnesses the crescent on the first night of the month, should fast therein, and whoever is sick or on a journey, fast the same number of days (make up from) other (later) days. Allah wants for you ease, and does not want hardship for you so that you complete the (same) number (of days), and that you should glorify Allah for guiding you so that you may be grateful to Him"
