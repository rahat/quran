    "text": "It is not piety that you turn your faces towards the east and (or) the west (in prayers); but piety is to believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the books, the prophets; give wealth in spite of love for it to relatives, orphans, poor, travelers, and to those who ask (for help); in ransom (to set free) of captives; establish prayer, pay obligatory charity, fulfill their promises when they make it, remain patient in adversity, affliction (disease), and at the time of fighting (war). Such are they who are truthful and they are pious"
