But if you are prevented (from completing them), then send sacrifice whatever you can afford, and donâ€™t shave your head until the offering reaches its appointed place. And whoever among you is sick or has an ailment in the scalp (needs shaving), then he must pay ransom either by fasting (for 3 days) or feeding the poor (6 people) or offering a sacrifice (one sheep). If you are safe (during peacetime) and whoever performs Umrah before the Hajj, then sacrifice whatever you can easily afford, but whoever cannot afford, then fast for 3 days during the pilgrimage and 7 days after return (to home), making 10 days in all. That is for those whose family is not present (non-resident) at the Sacred Masjid. Fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in punishment"
