    "text": "Allah does not burden any one but beyond his capacity. He will get reward for what he has earned (good) and be punished against what he earned (evil). (The believers say): \"Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error. Our Lord! Don’t lay on us a burden like that which You laid on those who were before us. Our Lord! Don’t lay on us burdens of which we don’t have power (to bear). Pardon us, forgive us, have mercy on us. You are our Protector, so grant us victory over the disbelievers"
