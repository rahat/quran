In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of the night and the day, and in the ships which sail through the sea which benefit the mankind, and in the rain which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive after its death, and in the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He scatters in it, and in the turning of winds and the clouds which are held between the sky and the earth; are indeed proofs for people of understanding"
