    "text": "O you who believe! Don’t render in vain your charity by reminder of generosity or by injury (feelings of recipients), like those who spend their wealth to be seen by people, and don’t believe in Allah, nor the Last Day. Their example is like a smooth rock with dust over it; and when heavy rain falls on it, leaves it bare. They have no control over anything (reward) which they have earned. Allah does not guide the disbelievers"
