    "text": "Yet, you are those who kill yourselves, drive out a group of you from their homes, and assist (their enemies) against them in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, though their expulsion was forbidden to you. Then do you believe in a part of the Scripture and reject the rest? Then what is the punishment of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, and they would be consigned to the most grievous punishment on the Day of Resurrection? Allah is not unaware of what you do"
