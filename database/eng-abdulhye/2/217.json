    "text": "They ask you (Muhammad) about fighting in the sacred month (1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of Islamic calendar). Say: \"Fighting in it is a great (offence). But preventing from the way of Allah, disbelieving in Allah, and expelling its inhabitants from the Sacred Masjid (at Makkah) are greater (offences) in the sight of Allah. Persecution is (more terrible) than killing. They (disbelievers) will not cease fighting you till they turn you back from your religion if they can. And whoever of you turns away from its religion and dies as a disbeliever, their (deeds are) rendered void in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will be the inmates of the fire. They will abide in it forever"
