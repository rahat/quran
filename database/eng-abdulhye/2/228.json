    "text": "And divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for 3 menstrual periods. It is not allowed for them that they conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have better right to take them back in that period, if they wish reconciliation. They (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in a just manner, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
