    "text": "Allah! There is no one worthy of worship except He, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer and Protector. Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what happens to them (creations) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they cannot gain access to anything out of His knowledge except what He wills. His Chair (Throne) extends over the heavens and the earth, and He does not feel fatigue in guarding them. He is the Exalted, the Great"
