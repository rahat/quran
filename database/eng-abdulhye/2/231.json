    "text": "When you divorce women and they reach their prescribed (waiting) period, then either take them back with honor or let them go with kindness. But don’t take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, surely, he wrongs himself. And don’t take the Verses of Allah as a joke. But remember the Favors of Allah upon you, and that which He has sent down upon you of the book (the Qur’an) and of the Wisdom (by which) He instructs you. And Fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything"
