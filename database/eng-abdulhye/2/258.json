    "text": "Have you not looked at him (Namrud) who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said to him: \"My Lord gives life and causes death.\" He said: \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Surely! Allah brings out the sun from the east; then you bring it from the west.\" So he who disbelieved was completely defeated. Allah does not guide the wrongdoers"
