    "text": "Those who eat interest (usury), they will not stand (before Allah) except like those who are confused (insane) by the touch of Satan. That is because they say: \"Indeed trade is like usury,‚Äù while Allah has made the trade lawful and the usury unlawful. So those who receive admonition from their Lord and they refrain, stop eating usury, shall not be punished for the past. Their case is left to Allah (to judge). But those who repeats (to usury), they are inmates of the fire; they will abide in it forever"
