    "text": "And if you divorce them before you touch (sexual relation with) them, and indeed you have fixed for them a settled portion (dower), then pay ½ of what you have fixed unless they (women) agree to give up, or he (the husband) agrees to give up (pay full dowry) in whose hand is the knot of marriage. If you agree to give up (full dowry) that is closer to piety. You don’t forget to show kindness among yourselves. Surely, Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
