    "text": "O you who believe! Retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder: the free for the free, and the captive for the captive, and the female for the female. But if the killer is forgiven by (victimâ€™s) brother (or relatives), then something (of blood money for killing should be decided) according to usage (with fairness) and payment be made to the heir (of the victim) in a good manner. This is less painful and a Mercy from your Lord. Whoever transgresses after this shall have a painful punishment"
