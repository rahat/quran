    "text": "Mankind was one community (with one religion). Allah sent the prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them sent the Scripture with the truth to judge between people in which they differed. Only those to whom the book (Scripture) was given differed in it after clear proofs came to them through hatred of one to another. Then Allah guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed. Allah guides whom He wills to Right Way"
