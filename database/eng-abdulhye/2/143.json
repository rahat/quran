    "text": "Thus We have made you a just nation so that you are witnesses over mankind and the Messenger be witness over you. And We have made the Qiblah (towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (disobey). Indeed it was hard test except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah does not let your faith (prayers) be lost. Truly, Allah is full of Kindness, the Merciful to mankind"
