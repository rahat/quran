    "text": "And don’t marry idolatresses (women worship idol) until they believe (in Allah alone). Indeed a believing captive woman is better than a free idolatress even though she pleases you. Don’t give (your daughters) in marriage to idolaters (men worship idol) until they believe in (Allah alone) and indeed a believing captive (man) is better than a free idolater even though he pleases you. Those (idolaters) invite you to the fire, and Allah invites you to Paradise and to forgiveness by His Grace. Allah makes His Verses clear to mankind so that they may remember"
