    "text": "The Jews say: “The Christians are not on anything right” and the Christians say: “The Jews are not on anything (right),” though they both recite the Scripture (Torah or Gospel). Similarly those who have no knowledge (the pagan Arabs) say: they like (both) their words. So Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that in which they have been differing"
