    "text": "There is no sin on you if you offer marriage proposal to (such) woman (during their waiting period) or you conceal it in yourselves. Allah knows that you will remember them (in your hearts), but don’t make a promise with them secretly except that you say (if you wish to marry) in an honorable manner. Don’t confirm on the tie of marriage till the prescribed term reaches its end. Know that Allah knows what is in your minds, so beware of Him. Know that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"
