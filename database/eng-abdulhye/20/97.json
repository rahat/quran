Surely, (the punishment) for you in this life is that you will say: ‘Don’t touch me (you will live alone in exile away from mankind)’; and surely you have a promise (of future punishment) that will not fail. Look at your deity which you have been devoted to it. Certainly we will burn it, and then certainly we will scatter its particles in the sea.”"
