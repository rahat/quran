    "text": "Has not the news come to you, of those before you, the people of Noah, Ad, and Thamud? Those after them? No one knows them but Allah. Their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands in their mouths (biting with anger) and said: “Surely, we disbelieve in what you have been sent with and we are really in strongly doubt as to what you invite us to it.”"
