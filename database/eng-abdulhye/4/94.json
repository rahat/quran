When you go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah, don’t distinguish and say to whoever offers to you greetings of peace: “You are not a believer” seeking advantage of life of this world. Allah has abundant booties like this for you. (Remember what) you were before but then Allah graced upon you. So distinguish (carefully before considering anyone disbeliever). Surely Allah is Well-Aware of what you do"
