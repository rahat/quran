    "text": "Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah has conferred abundantly one of them over others, and because they spend (to support) from their wealth. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands) who guard in husband’s absence what Allah has ordered them to guard (their chastity, their husband’s property). But those women whom you fear their rebellion, admonish them (first), and (then) leave them (alone) in the beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), then if they obey you, then don’t seek against them a way (excuse to punish). Surely, Allah is High, Great"
