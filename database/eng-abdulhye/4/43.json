    "text": "O you who believe! Donâ€™t offer the prayer while you are intoxicated until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are defiled (or in a state of sexual impurity) except when passing on way (traveling) until you wash yourselves. If you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you came from a toilet, or you had a sexual contact with women but did not find water, then do Tayammum with clean earth and rub with it your faces and your hands. Truly, Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving"
