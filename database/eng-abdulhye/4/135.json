You stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah, though it is against yourselves, or parents, and relatives whether the party is rich or poor; Allah has more right than both of them. So you donâ€™t follow your desires to do injustice. If you distort (facts) or you refrain, then (you should know that) Allah is Well-Aware of what you do"
