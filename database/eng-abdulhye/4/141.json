If there is a victory for you from Allah, they say: “Were we not with you?” But if there is a chance (of success) for disbelievers, they say: “Did we not have mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers (Muslims)?” Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will never make for the disbelievers over the believers a way (to triumph)"
