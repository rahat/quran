    "text": "Have you not seen those when it was said to them to hold back their hands (from fighting) and establish the prayer, and pay obligatory charity? Now, when the fighting is enjoined upon them, then a group of them fear people as they should have feared Allah or even greater fear, and say: “Our Lord! Why have You ordained on us the fighting? Why did not You defer it for us for another (short) period?\" Say (to them): “Enjoyment of this world is short.” The Hereafter is better for whoever fears Allah, and you shall not be (treated unjustly) in the least (even equal to the thread of a date-stone)"
