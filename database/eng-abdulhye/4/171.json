    "text": "O people of the Scripture! Don’t exceed the limits in your religion. Don’t say of Allah but the truth only. The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word “Be” which He conveyed to Mary and a soul from Him (was created by Him in her womb). So believe in Allah and His Messengers, you don’t say: “3 (trinity)!” Give up, it is better for you. Only Allah is one worthy of worship. Glory is to Him far above that He should have a son. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Allah is All-Sufficient as a Guardian"
