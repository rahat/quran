    "text": "They ask you to pronounce a ruling. Say: “Allah pronounces for you a ruling about Al-Kalala (who leaves behind no heirs). If a man dies, he does not have a child and a sister, then for her is ½ (inheritance) of what he has left. He (brother) will inherit her (sister) if she does not have a child. If there are 2 (sisters), then for them are 2/3rd of what he left, and if they were (many) brothers (and sisters) male and female, then the male will have the 2 shares (twice) of females. (Thus) Allah makes clear to you lest you go astray. Allah is All-Knower of everything"
