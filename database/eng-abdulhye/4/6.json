You donâ€™t eat it wastefully and hastily (fearing) that they would grow up (and demand it). Whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, should abstain entirely (from taking wages for taking care of their wealth), and whoever is poor, let him take what is just and reasonable. When you deliver their wealth to them, take witness in their presence. Allah is All-Sufficient in taking account"
