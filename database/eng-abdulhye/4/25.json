    "text": "And whoever of you is not able to afford that he marries free believing women, (they may wed) believing girls from among those (captives) whom your right hands possess, and Allah knows all about your faith, you are one from another. Then marry them with permission of their guardians and give them their bridal-due in a fair manner; they (the above said captive girls) should be chaste (in wedlock), not adulterous, nor give secret love affairs. When they are married, if they commit lewdness (illegal sexual intercourse), then upon them (punishment is) Â½ of what is upon the free (unmarried) women. This is for those who fear (falling into) sin but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
