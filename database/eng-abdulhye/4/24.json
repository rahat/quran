    "text": "(Also forbidden are) married women, except those (captives) whom your right hands possess. This is a decree of Allah upon you. Allah has made lawful for you those who are beyond these limits that you seek (them in marriage) by your wealth (with bridal gift) desiring chastity, not sin (commit illegal sexual intercourse). You benefit from them (enjoy sexual relations), give them their bridal-due as a duty; and there is no sin on you for what you mutually agree after its prescription. Surely, Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
