    "text": "It is not (appropriate) for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by mistake, then it is commanded to free a believing captive and blood-money (compensation) be paid to his (deceasedâ€™s) family, except that they remit it as a charity. If he is from enemy people to you and is a believer; then freedom of a believing captive (is sufficient). If he is from people between you and between them is a covenant, then blood-money is paid to the family, and freedom of a believing captive. But whoever does not find it (means to free a captive and or blood-money), then fast for 2 consecutive months seeking repentance from Allah. Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
