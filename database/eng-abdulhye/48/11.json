    "text": "Those of the Bedouins who stayed behind will say to you: “Our possessions and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: “Who then has any power (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah, if He intends to hurt you or intends to benefit you? Nay, but Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
