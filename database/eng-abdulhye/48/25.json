    "text": "They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from the sacred Masjid (of Makkah) and detained the sacrificed animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women (in Makkah) whom you did not know, and you may trample (heavily burst) them under your feet and thus incurring a sin committed by you without your knowledge (but Allah held back your hands), so that Allah may admit to His Mercy whom He wills. If they (believers and disbelievers) should have been apart, We would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment"
