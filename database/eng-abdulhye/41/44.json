What (a book if) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?” Say: “It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears, and it (the Qur’an) is blindness for them. They are those who are (as if) called from a place far away (so they neither hear nor understand)"
