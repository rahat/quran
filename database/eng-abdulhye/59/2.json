    "text": "It is He Who drove out those who disbelieve from the people of the Scripture (the Jews of Bani An-Nadheer) from their homes at the first gathering. You did not think that they would ever get out. They thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allahâ€™s (punishment) reached them from a place where from they did not expect it, and He cast fear into their hearts, so that they destroyed their own homes with their own hands and by the hands of the believers. So take admonition, O you with eyes (to see)"
