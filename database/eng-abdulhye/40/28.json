    "text": "And a believer from Pharaoh’s family, who hid his faith, said: “Will you kill a man because he says: ‘My Lord is Allah,’ especially when Moses has come to you with clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his sin will lie upon him; but if he is telling the truth, then some of that (calamity) which he threatens you will befall on you. Surely, Allah does not guide the one who is a polytheist, a liar"
