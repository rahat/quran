    "text": "There is no restriction on the blind, nor restriction on the lame, nor restriction on the sick, nor on yourselves, to eat from your houses, or houses of your fathers, or houses of your mothers, or houses of your brothers, or houses of your sisters, or houses of your paternal uncles, or houses of your paternal aunts, or houses of your maternal uncles, or houses of your maternal aunts, or that house you hold its keys, or your friend. There is no sin on you that you eat together or apart. But when you enter the houses, then greet one another with a greeting (of peace) from Allah, blessed and good. Thus Allah makes clear the Verses for you so that you may understand"
