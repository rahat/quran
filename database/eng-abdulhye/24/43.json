    "text": "Donâ€™t you see that Allah drives the clouds, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain comes forth from between them? He sends down hail like mountains from the sky, and strikes with them whom He wills, and averts from them whom He wills. The flash of its lightning nearly takes away the sight"
