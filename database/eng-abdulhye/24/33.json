    "text": "Let those who don’t find (financial means to) marry be chaste until Allah enriches them out of His Bounty. Those captives who seek a writing (of setting free) whom you possesses, give them in writing, if you find good in them, and give them from Allah’s wealth which He has bestowed upon you. Don’t force your maid captives into prostitution in order that you may seek gain of the worldly life, if they desire chastity. If anyone compels them (to prostitution), then surely after their compulsion, Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful (to those who are forced)"
