    "text": "Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will certainly make them vicegerent in the earth as He made vicegerent to those before them, and that He will establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them (Islam), and that He will surely give them a safe security in exchange of their fear provided they worship Me and donâ€™t associate anything with Me.
