    "text": "It was said to her: “Enter the palace.” (The floor was glass surface with water underneath it). But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (pulled up her clothes) uncovering her legs. Solomon said: “Surely, it is a palace (with a glass surface and water underneath it) traced smooth with glass.” She said: “My Lord! Surely, I have wronged myself, and I submit (accept Islam) with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”"
