A speaker from them said: “How long have you stayed here?” They said: “Perhaps we have stayed here for a day or part of a day.” They said: “Our Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. So send one of us with our silver coin to the city, and let him find out which is the purest food, and let him bring us some of it. Let him be careful and don’t let anyone know our whereabouts"
