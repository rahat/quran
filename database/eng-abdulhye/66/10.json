    "text": "Allah has set forth an example for the disbelievers: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under 2 of Allah’s righteous servants, but they both betrayed them (husbands by rejecting their doctrine). So they (Noah and Lot) could not protect them (their wives) from Allah at all, and it was said (to them): “Enter the fire along with those who enter!”"
