    "text": "O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may well be that your Lord will remit your sins from you and admit you into gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise). On that Day, Allah will not disgrace the prophet (Muhammad) and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and (their record of deeds) in their Right Hands, they will say: “Our Lord! Keep our light perfect for us and grant us forgiveness. Surely, Allah has power over all things.”"
