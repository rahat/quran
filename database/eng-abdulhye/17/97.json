    "text": "And those whom Allah guides are rightly guided; but those whom He sends astray, they will never find protectors for them besides Him. We shall gather them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode will be hell; whenever its flame abates, We shall increase the fierceness of fire for them"
