Get us out, (from now) we shall do righteous deeds and shall not repeat that (evil deeds) which we used to do.” (Allah will reply): “Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever would, could receive warning therein? And the Warner came to you. So taste (the evil of your deeds), there is no helper for the wrongdoers.”"
