    "text": "And leave alone those who take their religion as a play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. But remind them with it (the Qurâ€™an) lest their souls are caught for what they have earned. Neither will be for them besides Allah a protector nor an intercessor, and even if they offer ransom for every ransom, it will not be accepted from them. They are those who are caught for what they earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve"
