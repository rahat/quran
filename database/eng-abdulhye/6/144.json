Ask: “Has He forbidden you the 2 males or the 2 females or contain fetuses which the wombs of the 2 females (enclose)? Or were you present when Allah ordered you of this? Then who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah so as to mislead the people without knowledge? Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.”"
