    "text": "Those who made partners with Allah will say: “If Allah had willed, we would have made neither partner with Him, nor would our forefathers, nor we would have prohibited anything (against Him).” Likewise those who were before them rejected until they tasted Our punishment. Say: “Is there any knowledge (evidence) with you which you can provide to us? You follow nothing but guess and you are not but guessing.”"
