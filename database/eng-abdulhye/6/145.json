    "text": "Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t find in what has been revealed to me anything prohibited to be eaten by one who intends to eat it, except that it be dead animal or blood poured out, or flesh of pork: for that is surely unclean or impious (unlawful meat slaughtered) by invoking name of other than Allah. But whoever is forced (by necessity) neither craving nor transgressing, then certainly your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.”"
