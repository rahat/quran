    "text": "When Moses came at His appointment and his Lord spoke to him, he said: “O my Lord! Show me (power to see Yourself) so that I may look upon You.” Allah said: “You cannot see Me, but look at the mountain if it stands firm in its place then you shall see Me.” When his Lord revealed (His) Glory to the mountain, He made it collapse as dust, and Moses fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered, he said: “Glory be to You, I return to You (in repentance) and I am the first of the believers.”"
