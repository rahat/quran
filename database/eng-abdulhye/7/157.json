    "text": "Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet (Muhammad - could not read nor write) whom they will find written in the Torah and the Gospel, who commands them to good and forbids them from evil; and makes lawful to them the pure things and prohibits on them the impure things; and removes from them their burdens, and the fetters (bindings) which were upon them. So those who believe in him, support him, help him; follow the light (the Qurâ€™an) which has been sent with him, it is they who will be successful (in this world and Hereafter)"
