    "text": "Moses chose 70 men out of his people to (the place of) Our appointment. (On the way) when a violent earthquake seized them, he said: â€œO my Lord, had You willed, You could have destroyed them and me before. Would You destroy us for what the fools did among us? It was not but Your trial by which You mislead with it whom You willed, and You guided whom You willed. You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have Mercy on us, and You are the best of those who forgive"
