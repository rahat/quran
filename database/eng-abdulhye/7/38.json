    "text": "(Allah) will say: “You enter in the fire and join among nations of jinns and human who have passed away before you.” Every time a group will enter, it will curse its sister (preceding group) until they all will gather in it. The last of them will say to the first of them: “Our Lord! These have misled us, so give them double punishment of the fire.” He will say: “For every one there will be double (punishment), though you may not know.”"
