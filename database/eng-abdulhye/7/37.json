They are those whose share will reach them from the book (of decrees) until when Our Messengers (angels of death) come to them causing them to die, they (angels) will say: “Where are those whom you used to invoke other than Allah?” They will reply: “They have forsaken us.” They will testify against themselves that indeed they were disbelievers"
