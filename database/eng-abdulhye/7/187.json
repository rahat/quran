    "text": "They ask you (O Muhammad) about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “Its knowledge is only with my Lord (alone). None can disclose its time but He. It will weigh heavy in the heavens and the earth. It shall not come to you but suddenly.” They ask you as if you are very knowledgeable about it. Say: “Only its knowledge is with Allah (alone) but most people don’t know.”"
