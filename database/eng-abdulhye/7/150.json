    "text": "And when Moses returned to his people, became angry and grieved, he said: “What an evil thing you have done (worship the calf) after me! Did you hasten to decree (for punishment) of your Lord?” He threw down the tablets and seized his brother by his head dragging him to himself. (Aaron) said: “O son of my mother! Indeed the people overpowered me weak and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice over me, and don’t place me with the wrongdoers.”"
