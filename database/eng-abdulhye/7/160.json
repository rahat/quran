When his people asked him for water, We inspired to Moses (saying): “Strike the stone with your stuff,” and there gushed out of it 12 springs, each group knew its drinking place. We provided shades of clouds on them and sent down upon them Manna (sweet dish) and Salva (quail’s meat) (saying): “Eat of the good things which We have provided you.” (They rebelled and) they did not harm Us but they were doing wrong to themselves"
