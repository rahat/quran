When the Day will come, its reality will be unfolded, those who had forgotten it before, will say: “Surely, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth. Do we have any intercessors now, who might intercede for us? Or could we be sent back (to world) so that we would do good deeds other than those evil deeds we used to do?” Surely, they have lost themselves and whatever they used to fabricate has forsaken them"
