    "text": "Then We sent after them, Our Messengers, and We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and gave him the gospel. And We placed compassion and Mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe it for them but they sought to please Allah, but they did not observe it with the right of its observance. Yet, We rewarded those among them who believed, but many of them are rebellious"
