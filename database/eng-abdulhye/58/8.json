    "text": "Have you not seen those who were forbidden from secret counsels, and afterwards they returned to what they were forbidden from it? They conspired together for sin, wrong doing, and disobedience to the Messenger (Muhammad). Yet, when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting with which Allah does not greet you, and they say to themselves: “Why Allah does not punish us for what we say?” Hell will be sufficient for them, they will burn in it, and worst indeed is that destination"
