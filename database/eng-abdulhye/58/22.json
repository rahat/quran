    "text": "You (O Muhammad) will never find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day on friendly terms with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they are their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written faith in their hearts and has strengthened them with spirit (true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to reside in it forever. Allah will be pleased with them, and they will be pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Lo! Surely it is the party of Allah that will be the successful"
