For such He has written faith in their hearts and has strengthened them with spirit (true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to reside in it forever. Allah will be pleased with them, and they will be pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Lo! Surely it is the party of Allah that will be the successful"

So take admonition, O you with eyes (to see)"
