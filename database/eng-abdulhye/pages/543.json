There is no secret counsel of 3, but He is their 4th (with His knowledge), nor of 5 but He is their 6th, nor of less than that or more, but He is with them wherever they may be. Then on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Surely, Allah is All-Knower of everything"

They conspired together for sin, wrong doing, and disobedience to the Messenger (Muhammad). Yet, when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting with which Allah does not greet you, and they say to themselves: “Why Allah does not punish us for what we say?” Hell will be sufficient for them, they will burn in it, and worst indeed is that destination"
