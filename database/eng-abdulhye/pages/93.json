Whoever kills a believer by mistake, then it is commanded to free a believing captive and blood-money (compensation) be paid to his (deceased’s) family, except that they remit it as a charity. If he is from enemy people to you and is a believer; then freedom of a believing captive (is sufficient). If he is from people between you and between them is a covenant, then blood-money is paid to the family, and freedom of a believing captive. But whoever does not find it (means to free a captive and or blood-money), then fast for 2 consecutive months seeking repentance from Allah. Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"

When you go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah, don’t distinguish and say to whoever offers to you greetings of peace: “You are not a believer” seeking advantage of life of this world. Allah has abundant booties like this for you. (Remember what) you were before but then Allah graced upon you. So distinguish (carefully before considering anyone disbeliever). Surely Allah is Well-Aware of what you do"
