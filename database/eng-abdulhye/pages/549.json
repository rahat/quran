Would you show affection towards them, when they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth (Islam) and have driven out the Messenger (Muhammad) and yourselves (from your homeland), simply because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My good pleasure, then how can you show friendship to them in secret? I am aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed has gone astray from the Right Way"

When they said to their people: “Surely, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allah. We reject you. Hostility and hatred shall appear between us and between you forever until you believe in Allah alone.” Except the saying of Abraham to his father: “Surely, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allah) for you, but I have no power to get anything for you from Allah.” (They prayed): “Our Lord! In You (alone) we put our trust, to You (alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (alone) is the final return"
