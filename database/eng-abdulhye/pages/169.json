Did you hasten to decree (for punishment) of your Lord?” He threw down the tablets and seized his brother by his head dragging him to himself. (Aaron) said: “O son of my mother! Indeed the people overpowered me weak and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice over me, and don’t place me with the wrongdoers.”"

You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have Mercy on us, and You are the best of those who forgive"
