Allah knows that you will remember them (in your hearts), but don’t make a promise with them secretly except that you say (if you wish to marry) in an honorable manner. Don’t confirm on the tie of marriage till the prescribed term reaches its end. Know that Allah knows what is in your minds, so beware of Him. Know that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"

If you agree to give up (full dowry) that is closer to piety. You don’t forget to show kindness among yourselves. Surely, Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
