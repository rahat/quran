Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars"

They fight in Allah’s Way, so they kill others and are killed. It is a true promise which is binding on Him mentioned in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur’an. Who is truer to (fulfill) its covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in your bargain which you have made with it. That is the supreme success"
