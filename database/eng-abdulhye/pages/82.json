Allah has made lawful for you those who are beyond these limits that you seek (them in marriage) by your wealth (with bridal gift) desiring chastity, not sin (commit illegal sexual intercourse). You benefit from them (enjoy sexual relations), give them their bridal-due as a duty; and there is no sin on you for what you mutually agree after its prescription. Surely, Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"

Then marry them with permission of their guardians and give them their bridal-due in a fair manner; they (the above said captive girls) should be chaste (in wedlock), not adulterous, nor give secret love affairs. When they are married, if they commit lewdness (illegal sexual intercourse), then upon them (punishment is) Â½ of what is upon the free (unmarried) women. This is for those who fear (falling into) sin but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
