If there are more than 2 daughters, then for them is 2/3rd of what was left (inheritance); and if there is only one daughter, then her share is ½. For parents, each one of them will get 1/6th of what was left if the deceased left children behind, and if the deceased left no children and the parents are only heirs, then the mother shall get 1/3rd and if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), then the mother will get 1/6th. (This distribution in all cases shall be) after fulfilling the terms of the (last) will and the payment of debts. With respect to parents and children, you don’t know who is more beneficial to you; therefore Allah has issued this ordnance. Indeed Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
