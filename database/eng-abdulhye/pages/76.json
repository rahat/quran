So those who emigrated, or were driven out from their homes, and those who were persecuted in My cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My cause); surely, I will remit from them their evil deeds and will certainly admit them to gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), a reward from Allah. Allah holds best of rewards.”"
