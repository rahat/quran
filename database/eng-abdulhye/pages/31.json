Whoever intends to perform Hajj in these months, then (there should be) no obscenity (sexual relations), nor wickedness (obscene language), nor wrangling (dispute unjustly) during the Hajj. Whatever good you do, Allah knows it. Take provision with you for the journey, but surely the best provision is piety. So fear Me, O people of understanding"
