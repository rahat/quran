You have put into sheets for people, you disclose some of it and you conceal most of it. Though you were taught (through the Qur’an) what neither you know nor your forefathers knew.” (If they don’t answer) say: “Allah (sent it).” Then leave them in their arguments they play"

This Day you shall be recompensed with the punishment of humiliation for what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. You used to be arrogant concerning His Verses"
