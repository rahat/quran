Those captives who seek a writing (of setting free) whom you possesses, give them in writing, if you find good in them, and give them from Allah’s wealth which He has bestowed upon you. Don’t force your maid captives into prostitution in order that you may seek gain of the worldly life, if they desire chastity. If anyone compels them (to prostitution), then surely after their compulsion, Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful (to those who are forced)"

The parable of His Light is as a niche within it is a lamp, the lamp (is enclosed) in a glass, the glass as if it were a brilliant star, it is lit from oil of a blessed olive tree which is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil would almost glow forth, though no fire touched it. Light upon light! Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. And He sets forth such parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything"
