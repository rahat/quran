Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and what was revealed at (the city of) Babylon to the 2 angels, Harut and Marut. Neither of these 2 angels taught (magic) anyone till they had said: “We are only for trial, so don’t disbelieve.” (In spite of this warning) people did learn from these 2 angels by which they could separate between husband and wife, but they could not harm anyone with it except by the permission of Allah. And they learned what harms them and not profits them. Indeed they knew that whoever buys it (magic), there is no share in the Hereafter. How bad indeed was what they sold it for their own selves, if they but knew"
