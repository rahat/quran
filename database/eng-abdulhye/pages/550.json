If you ascertain that they are true believers, don’t send them back to the disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for them (disbelievers), nor are they (disbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them. But give them (disbelievers) that (amount of money) which they have spent (as their dowries) to them. There is no sin on you to marry them if you pay them their dowries. Likewise don’t hold the disbelieving women as wives. Ask for (the return of) that which you have spent (as dowry) and let them (disbelievers) ask back for what they have spent. This is the judgment of Allah. He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"

Fear Allah, in whom you believe"
