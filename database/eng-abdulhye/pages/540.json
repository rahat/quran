It is like the vegetation (flourishes) after rain: its growth pleases the tillers; afterwards it dries up and you see it turn yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter, there will be severe punishment (for disbelievers) and forgiveness from Allah and (His) good pleasure (for the believers). The life of this world is not but a deceiving enjoyment"
