Another group was concerned about themselves (on how to save themselves, ignoring the others and the prophet) and thought wrongly of Allah, thought of the (days of) ignorance. They said: “Is there anything for us in the affair?” Say (O Muhammad): “Indeed all the affairs are for Allah.” They hide within themselves (in mind) what they did not reveal to you, saying: “If there was anything for us in the affair, none of us would have been killed here.” Say (to them): “Even if you had remained in your houses, those for whom death were destined would have gone forth to the place of their death. But it was the test of Allah what was in your hearts, and to purify what was in your hearts (sins). Allah is All-Knower of what is in the hearts.”"

Don’t be like those disbelievers and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or are fighting: “If they had stayed with us, neither they would have died nor be killed.” Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. Allah gives life and causes death. Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
