The Prophets used to judge with it, whoever had submitted (to Allah) from those became Jews, so did scholars and Rabbis. They were entrusted the protection of the Book of Allah, and they were witnesses to it. So you don’t fear the people but fear Me, and you don’t sell My Verses for a little price. Whoever does not judge by what Allah has sent down; those are indeed the disbelievers"
