If they had a child, then for you a 1/4th of what they left after fulfilling the term of their (last) will and the payment of debt. For your wives a 1/4th of what you have left if you did not leave a child. If you leave a child, then for them is 1/8th of what you have left behind, after fulfilling the terms of your (last) will and the payment of debt. If man or woman is testator having no parents and children or women but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of the 2 is a 1/6th. But if they are more than 2, then they shall share in a 1/3rd after fulfilling the terms of the (last) will and the payment of debt, without being harmful (no loss to anyone). This is the commandment from Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing"
