They had enjoyed their portion (worldly life), so enjoy your portion (a while) as those before you enjoyed their portion (a while); and you indulge in play and pastime as they indulged in play and pastime. Such are they whose deeds are in vain in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers"
