If a man dies, he does not have a child and a sister, then for her is ½ (inheritance) of what he has left. He (brother) will inherit her (sister) if she does not have a child. If there are 2 (sisters), then for them are 2/3rd of what he left, and if they were (many) brothers (and sisters) male and female, then the male will have the 2 shares (twice) of females. (Thus) Allah makes clear to you lest you go astray. Allah is All-Knower of everything"

Don’t violate (the sanctity of the) symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals (brought for sacrifice), nor of the garlanded (animals marked for security), nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah) seeking the Bounty of their Lord and good pleasure. When you finish the Ihram (Pilgrimage), you may hunt. Let not the hatred of some people, who once stopped you from the Sacred Masjid (at Makkah), lead you to transgress. You help one another in righteousness and piety; and don’t help one another in sin and transgression. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Severe in punishment"
