Those who believe may increase in faith (in Qur’an). Those who were given the Scripture and believers may say to those in whose hearts there is a disease (hypocrisy) and the disbelievers say: “What Allah means by this example?” Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. No one knows the forces of your Lord but He. This (Qur’an) is nothing but a reminder to mankind"
