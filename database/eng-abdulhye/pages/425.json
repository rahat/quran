There is no sin on you if you desire any of those whom you have set aside (temporarily). It is better that their eyes may be cooled and they don’t grieve, and may be pleased with what you give all of them. And Allah knows what is in your hearts. Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing"

But when you are invited, then enter and when you have taken your meal, then disperse, without sitting for a talk. Surely, such behavior annoys the prophet, he is shy in asking you to leave, but Allah is not shy of telling you the truth. When you ask them (his wives) for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. This is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. It is not proper for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Surely! With Allah that would be a grievous offence"
