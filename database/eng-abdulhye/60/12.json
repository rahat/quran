When the believing women come to you to give you the pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, that they will not forge between their hands and their feet (falsehood by accusing another women of having illicit relationship with a man or making illegal children and making husband believe that it belongs to her husband), they will not disobey you in any just matter (permitted by Islam), then accept their pledge, and ask Allah to forgive them. Surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
