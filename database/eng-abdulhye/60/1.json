    "text": "O you who believe! Donâ€™t take My enemies and your enemies (disbelievers) as friends. Would you show affection towards them, when they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth (Islam) and have driven out the Messenger (Muhammad) and yourselves (from your homeland), simply because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My good pleasure, then how can you show friendship to them in secret? I am aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed has gone astray from the Right Way"
