    "text": "And when some trouble touches people, they cry to their Lord, turning to Him in repentance. But when He bestows a Favor upon them from Him, they forget what they had supplicated (cried) to Him before, and they set up rivals to Allah in order to mislead others from His Way. Say: “Take pleasure in your disbelief for a while. Surely, you will be one of the inmates of the fire!”"
