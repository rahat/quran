    "text": "Allah has sent down the best statement, a book (this Qurâ€™an), its parts resemble each other, often repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skins and their hearts soften to the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah. He guides whom He pleases and whomever He sends astray, there is no guide for him"
