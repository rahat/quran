    "text": "O Prophet (Muhammad)! When you (the believers) divorce women, divorce them at (end of) their prescribed (waiting) periods, and count their periods (correctly). Fear Allah, your Lord. Don’t turn them out from their (husband’s) homes (waiting period), nor they should leave (themselves), unless they have committed adultery openly. These are the limits of Allah. Whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, then indeed has wronged itself. You (one who divorces wife) never know, Allah may bring something new (situation) after that (reconciliation for her return back to you)"
