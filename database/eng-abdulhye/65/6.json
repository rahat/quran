    "text": "Let them (divorced women during their waiting period) live where you yourself live according to your means. You donâ€™t harm them so as to straiten them (make their life intolerable and leave your house). If they are pregnant, then spend on them till they deliver their burden. Then if they give suck (to the children) for you, then give them their due payment (compensation), and let each of you accept the advice of the other between you in a just way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may give suck for you (father of the child)"
