When you finish the Ihram (Pilgrimage), you may hunt. Let not the hatred of some people, who once stopped you from the Sacred Masjid (at Makkah), lead you to transgress. You help one another in righteousness and piety; and don’t help one another in sin and transgression. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Severe in punishment"

All these are sins (disobedience of Allah). This Day, those who have given up all hope, disbelieved of your religion. So you don’t fear them, but fear Me. This Day, I have perfected for you your religion, completed upon you My Favor, and has approved for you Islam as your religion. Whoever is forced by hunger, not inclined to sin (not eaten forbidden food), then surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
