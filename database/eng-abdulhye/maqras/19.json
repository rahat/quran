But those who repeats (to usury), they are inmates of the fire; they will abide in it forever"

A scribe shall not refuse to write it down as Allah has taught, so let the scribe write. Let him (debtor) dictate on whom is the liability fearing Allah, the Lord, and not diminish anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is not capable to dictate for itself, then let its guardian dictate in justice. Call for 2 witnesses out of your own men. If 2 men are not available, then a man and 2 women, such as you agree as witnesses, so that if one of the 2 women errs, one of them (2 women) reminds other. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called (for evidence). Don’t become weary to write down your contract, small or large for its period. That is more just with Allah, more reliable for evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, except when it is a present trade which you carry out among yourselves, and then there is no sin on you if you don’t write it down. But take witnesses when you trade with one another. Let neither scribe nor witness suffer any harm, and if you do (such harm), then it is wickedness on your part. So fear Allah and Allah teaches you. Allah is All-Knower of every thing"
