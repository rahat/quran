    "text": "He has ordained for you the same religion (Islam) which He ordained for Noah, and which He has revealed to you (O Muhammad), and which He ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus (saying): “You should establish religion, and not be divided in it (various sects).” Intolerable is for the polytheists to which you (O Muhammad) call them to it.
