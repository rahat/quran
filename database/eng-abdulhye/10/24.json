    "text": "Surely the likeness of the worldly life is as the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, it mingles with it (soil) and produces of the earth which people and cattle eat; until when the earth takes its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all the powers of disposal over it, Our command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus We explain in detail the Verses for the people who think"
