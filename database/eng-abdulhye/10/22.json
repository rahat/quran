    "text": "It is Allah who enables you to travel through land and sea; until when you are in the ships and they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they are glad in it; but when a stormy wind comes to it and the waves come to them from every place and they think that they are being encircled in it. Then they pray to Allah, making their faith pure for Him alone (saying): “If You (Allah) deliver us from this, we shall truly be of the grateful.”"
