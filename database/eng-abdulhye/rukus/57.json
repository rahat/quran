They said: “Is there anything for us in the affair?” Say (O Muhammad): “Indeed all the affairs are for Allah.” They hide within themselves (in mind) what they did not reveal to you, saying: “If there was anything for us in the affair, none of us would have been killed here.” Say (to them): “Even if you had remained in your houses, those for whom death were destined would have gone forth to the place of their death. But it was the test of Allah what was in your hearts, and to purify what was in your hearts (sins). Allah is All-Knower of what is in the hearts.”"
