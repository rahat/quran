So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality (divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no blame on the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (divorced) from them. And the Command of Allah must be fulfilled"
