It is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) what you have given them (wives) anything, except that both fear that you will not be able to keep the limits of Allah. Then if you fear that you will not be able to keep the limits of Allah, then there is no sin on both of you if she gives back for her divorce. These are the limits of Allah, so don’t transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, then those are the wrongdoers"

And Fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything"
