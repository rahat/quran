But if the killer is forgiven by (victimâ€™s) brother (or relatives), then something (of blood money for killing should be decided) according to usage (with fairness) and payment be made to the heir (of the victim) in a good manner. This is less painful and a Mercy from your Lord. Whoever transgresses after this shall have a painful punishment"
