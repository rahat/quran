Eat and drink until the white thread (light of dawn) becomes distinct to you from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete fasts till the nightfall. And don’t approach them (your wives) while you are confining yourselves in the Masjids (I’tikaf during the last 10 days of Ramadan). These are the limits of Allah, so don’t approach them. Allah makes clear His Verses to mankind so that they may become pious"
