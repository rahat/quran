The parable of His Light is as a niche within it is a lamp, the lamp (is enclosed) in a glass, the glass as if it were a brilliant star, it is lit from oil of a blessed olive tree which is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil would almost glow forth, though no fire touched it. Light upon light! Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. And He sets forth such parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything"
