But the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing in a reasonable manner. No one should be charged more than they can afford. Neither a mother should be made to suffer for her child, nor a father to whom the child is born. On the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (on the father). If both decide on weaning (withhold mother’s milk and use other nourishment) by mutual consent and after due consultation, then there is no sin on them. If you decide to give out to nurse (foster mother) for your children, then there is no sin on you when you pay (the mother) what is due from you in an honorable manner. Fear Allah and know well that Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
