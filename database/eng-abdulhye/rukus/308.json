Let your servants and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty, should ask your permission (before they come to your presence) on 3 occasions: before Fajr (morning) prayer, while you put off your clothes for the noonday (rest) and after the Isha (late-night) prayer. These 3 times are for your privacy. There is no sin on you or on them afterwards to go around visiting one another. Thus Allah makes the Verses clear to you. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
