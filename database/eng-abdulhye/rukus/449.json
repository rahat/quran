You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) good pleasure. The mark of them (their faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration. This is their description in the Torah. Their description in the Gospel is like a seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, it then becomes thick, and it stands right on its stem delighting the sowers (of the seed) so that He may make the disbelievers angry with them. Those among them who believe and do righteous deeds, Allah has Promised forgiveness and a great reward"
