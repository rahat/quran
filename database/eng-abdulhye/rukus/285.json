And We cause it to remain in the wombs whom We will for an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then you may reach your age of full strength. Among you there are some who die (young), and among you there are some who are brought back to the miserable (old) age, so that they donâ€™t know anything after having known. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) on it, it is stirred to life; it swells, and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth)"
