If you are (in state of) Janaba (had sexual discharge), then purify yourself (take full bath). If you are ill or on a journey or one has come out from the toilet, or you have been in sexual contact (with wives), make Tayammum if you don’t find water, then look for clean earth and you wipe your faces and hands with it. Allah does not want to lay upon you any hardship, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favor upon you so that you may be thankful"
