When they finish prostrations, then let them (take positions) in your rear and let other group come up who has not yet prayed to pray with you, and let them take their precaution and their arms. Those who disbelieve wish, if you neglect your arms and your baggage, then they could jump upon you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you lay aside your arms due to inconvenience with you of rain or that you are sick, but take precaution for yourselves. Surely, Allah has prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers"
