He knows what happens to them (creations) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they cannot gain access to anything out of His knowledge except what He wills. His Chair (Throne) extends over the heavens and the earth, and He does not feel fatigue in guarding them. He is the Exalted, the Great"
