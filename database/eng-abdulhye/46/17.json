Do you hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up again and surely generations before me have passed away (without rising)?” While they (father and mother) invoke Allah (for help and rebuke their son): “Woe to you! Believe! Surely, the Promise of Allah is true.” But he says: “This is nothing but the tales of the ancient.”"
