    "text": "Ask (O Muhammad): “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say: “Allah.” Ask: “Have you then taken (for worship) protectors other than Him who have no power for themselves either for benefit or for harm?” Say: “Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation seemed alike to them?” Say: “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Irresistible.”"
