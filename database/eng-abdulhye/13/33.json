    "text": "Is it He who takes charge of every one by what he has earned it? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: “Name them! Or will you inform Him of what He does not know in the earth or is it just a show of false words?” Nay! To those who disbelieve, their plotting is made fair-seeming, and they have been hindered from the Right Way, and those whom Allah sends astray, there is no guide for them"
