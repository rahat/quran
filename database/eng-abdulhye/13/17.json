    "text": "He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure, but the flood bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface, and also from that ore they heat it in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils, raises foam like to it. Thus Allah does set forth examples of truth and falsehood. As for the foam it passes away as scum upon the banks, while that which benefits mankind remains in the earth. Thus Allah sets forth examples"
