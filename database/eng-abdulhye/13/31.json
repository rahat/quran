    "text": "And if there had been a Qur’an with it mountains could be moved, or with it the earth could be cloven asunder, or with it the dead could be made to speak (it would be the same Qur’an). But the decision of all things is certainly with Allah. Yet those who believe have not known that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind? A disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieve because what (evil) they did or it (disaster) settles close to their homes, until the Promise of Allah comes. Certainly, Allah does not break His Promise"
