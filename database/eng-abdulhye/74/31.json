    "text": "And We have set none but angels as guardians of the fire. We have not fixed their numbers (19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve in order that those who were given the Scripture may be convinced (Qur’an is the truth as it agrees with their books i.e. number (19) is written in the Torah and the Gospel). Those who believe may increase in faith (in Qur’an). Those who were given the Scripture and believers may say to those in whose hearts there is a disease (hypocrisy) and the disbelievers say: “What Allah means by this example?” Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. No one knows the forces of your Lord but He. This (Qur’an) is nothing but a reminder to mankind"
