    "text": "A declaration from Allah and His Messenger to mankind on the greatest day of pilgrimage that Allah is free from all obligations to the polytheists and so is His Messenger. So if you (polytheists) repent, it is better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape (from the punishment of) Allah. Give tidings (O Muhammad) to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment"
