    "text": "It is not proper for the people of Madinah and those around them of the Bedouins to remain behind from Allahâ€™s Messenger or to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they neither afflicts them any thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Way of Allah, nor take any step to anger the disbelievers, nor inflict any injury upon an enemy, but shall be written to their credit as a righteous deed. Surely, Allah does not waste the reward of the righteous people"
