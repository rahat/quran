    "text": "If you don’t help him (Muhammad), (does not matter) indeed Allah did help him when those who disbelieve drove him out (of his town), the 2nd of 2, when they (Muhammad and Abu Bakr) were in the cave (the enemy came close to the opening of the cave), when he (Muhammad) said to his companion (Abu Bakr): “Don’t worry, surely Allah is with us.” Then Allah sent down His Peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you did not see, thus made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the Words of Allah remain uppermost. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
