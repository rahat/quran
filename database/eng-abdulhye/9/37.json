    "text": "Indeed the postponing (of a sacred month) is an addition to disbelief; thereby those who disbelieve are led to astray. They make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months which Allah has forbidden, and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their deeds is made pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the people, who disbelieve"
