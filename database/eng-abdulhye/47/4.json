    "text": "So, when you meet (fight with) those who disbelieve, strike at their necks till you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (and take them as captives). After the war lays down its burden, then either show generosity (free them without ransom), or ransom (to benefit Islam). But if Allah had willed, He could certainly have won over them. But (He adapted this way) in order to test some of you with others. Those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost"
