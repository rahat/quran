    "text": "The description of Paradise which has been Promised for those who fear is that there are rivers of water not stagnant in it, rivers of milk whose taste never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of clarified honey. In it, they will have every kind of fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. (Are these) like those who shall reside forever in the fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their intestines"
