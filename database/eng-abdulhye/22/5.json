    "text": "O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then remember, We have created you from dust, then from a mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge (sperm), then from a clot (thick coagulated blood), then from a little lump of human flesh formed and unformed (miscarriage), so that We may make it clear to you. And We cause it to remain in the wombs whom We will for an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then you may reach your age of full strength. Among you there are some who die (young), and among you there are some who are brought back to the miserable (old) age, so that they donâ€™t know anything after having known. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) on it, it is stirred to life; it swells, and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth)"
