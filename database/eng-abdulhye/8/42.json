If you had made a mutual appointment to meet, you would surly have failed in the appointment; but Allah might accomplish a matter that was already ordained (in His Knowledge), so that those who were destined to perish might die with a clear evidence, and those who were destined to live (believers) might live with a clear evidence. Surely, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
