    "text": "Surely, those who believed, emigrated, and strove hard and fought with their property and their lives in the way of Allah; and those who gave asylum and help; these are all allies to one another. As to those who believed but did not emigrate, you owe no duty of protection to them until they emigrate; but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance. Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
