Don’t be like those disbelievers and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or are fighting: “If they had stayed with us, neither they would have died nor be killed.” Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. Allah gives life and causes death. Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
