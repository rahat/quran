I will make for you from clay like a figure of a bird, breathe into it, and it will become a bird by the permission of Allah. I will heal the born blind, leper, and will bring life to the dead by the permission of Allah. I will inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses. Surely, in these are signs for you, if you believe"
