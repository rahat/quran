The true Guidance is the Guidance of Allah.” (These people of the book don’t believe) that someone (besides them) could be given revelation like what you have been given, or they will argue with you before your Lord. Say (O Muhammad): “Surely! All the Bounty is in the Hand of Allah; Allah gives it to whom He wills. And Allah is Generous, All-knower.”"
