    "text": "Indeed Allah was truthful in His Promise to you when you were destroying them (your enemy in the battle of Uhud) with His permission, until when you showed weakness and fell into dispute about the order, and disobeyed (the prophet) after what He showed you (the booty) which you loved. There were some among you who desire this world and some of you who desire the Hereafter. Then He made you flee from them (your enemy) so that He may test you. Surely, He forgave you, and Allah is Gracious to the believers"
