    "text": "O Prophet (Muhammad)! Surely, We have made lawful to you: your wives to whom you have paid their bridal money (given by husband to wife at the time of marriage); those (captives) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allah has given to you; the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who have migrated (from Makkah) with you; a believing woman if she offers herself to the prophet and if the Prophet wishes to marry her - a privilege for you (only) other than the believers. Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them (believers) about their wives and those (captives) whom their right hands possess, in order that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
