    "text": "they are miserly towards you (to help in Allahâ€™s cause). When fear comes (to them), you will see them looking to you, revolving their eyes as if their deaths hover over them, but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, become miserly towards (spending on) good. Such people have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless, and that is very easy for Allah"
