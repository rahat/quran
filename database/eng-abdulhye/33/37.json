    "text": "And (remember) when you (Muhammad) said to him (Zaid, prophet’s adopted son) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding to Islam) and you too have done favor (by freeing from captivity): “Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah.” But you did hide in yourself what (Allah has already made known to you that He will give her (Zaid’s wife) to you in marriage) Allah will make it clear and you did fear the people (that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his captive) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So when Zaid had performed the necessary formality (divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no blame on the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (divorced) from them. And the Command of Allah must be fulfilled"
