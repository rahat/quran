    "text": "You (O Muhammad) can postpone (the turn for your company) whom you will of them (your wives), and you may receive to you whom you will. There is no sin on you if you desire any of those whom you have set aside (temporarily). It is better that their eyes may be cooled and they donâ€™t grieve, and may be pleased with what you give all of them. And Allah knows what is in your hearts. Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing"
