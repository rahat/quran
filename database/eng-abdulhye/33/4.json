    "text": "Allah has not put 2 hearts in one person’s body. Neither has He made your wives whom you declare (divorce) through Zihar to be like your mother’s backs, (Zihar is the saying of a husband to his wife: \"you are to me like the back of my mother\" i.e. you are unlawful for me to approach, deprive her rights and keep her like a captive and don’t let her marry anyone else) as your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is your saying with your mouths. But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the Right Way"
