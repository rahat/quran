    "text": "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their (believersâ€™) mothers. Those who are blood relations, some of them are closer to each other in the Decree of Allah (regarding inheritance) than (the brotherhood of) the believers and the emigrants (from Makkah to Madinah), except that you do kindness to your brothers. This has been written in the book (of divine Decrees)"
