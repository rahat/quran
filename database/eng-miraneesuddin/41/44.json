What ! a ( book in ) foreign ( language ) and ( the messenger and those addressed ) Arabs?” Say, “For those who believe, it is a guide and a healing, and ( for ) those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears and it is obscure to them, ( it is as if ) they are called from a far off place"
