And (you) should be good to parents and you should not kill your children because of (the fear of) poverty, We provide for you and for them too, and (you) should not go near indecencies (both) those of them which are open and those which are secret and (you) should not kill a soul (anyone, the killing of) whom God has made unlawful except in the cause of justice. That He directs you with, that you may understand"
