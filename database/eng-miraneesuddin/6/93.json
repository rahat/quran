(This) day you will be rewarded with a shameful punishment because you used to speak about God (something) other than the truth, and you used to consider yourselves great with regard to (the acceptance) of His signs.\" about God (something) other than the truth, and you used to consider yourselves great with regard to (the acceptance) of His signs"
