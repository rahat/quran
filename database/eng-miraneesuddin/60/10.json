    "text": "O you who believe ! when believing immigrant women come to you then examine them, God knows best their belief, but if you (too) know them to be believers then do not return them to the disbelievers, they are not lawful for them nor the (disbelievers) are lawful for them and give the (disbelievers) that which they have spent (on them), and there is no sin on you to marry them when you give them their dowries. And do not retain the ties of marriage with the disbelieving women. And ask for (the return of) that which you have spent and let them ask for (the return of) that which they have spent, that is the judgment of God (with which) He judges between you and God is Knowing, Wise"
