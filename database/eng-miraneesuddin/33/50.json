We have certainly made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their dowries and those whom your right hand possesses from among the prisoners of war whom God has given to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you and a believing woman if she gave herself to the prophet, if the prophet (too) intends (to seek) her in marriage, exclusively for you not for the (other) believers, We know what We have appointed for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess, (this is clarified so) that there should not be any blame on you, and God is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
