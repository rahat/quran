Its morning (journey was equal to the journey of) a month and its evening (journey was equal to the journey of) a month and We made a fountain of copper to flow for him (probably in the form of a volcanic eruption) and from among the jinn (We gave him those) who worked before him by the order of his Lord, and whoever from among them deviated from Our command, We made him taste (something) from the punishment of blazing fire"
