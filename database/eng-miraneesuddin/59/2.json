You did not expect that they will go out while they expected that their fortresses would defend them against God, but God came to them (to punish them) from a place which they could not (even) imagine, and He cast terror into their hearts so that their houses were ruined with their own hands and the hands of the believers, so learn a lesson O you who have insight"
