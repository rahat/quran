Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had God willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of God, He will never render their deeds void"
