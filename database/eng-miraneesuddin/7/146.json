    "text": "I will turn away from My signs those who exhibit greatness in the earth without having the right to do so, and even if they see every sign they will not believe in it, and if they see the right way, they will not take it as (their) way, but if they see the way of error, they will take it as (their) way. That is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them"
