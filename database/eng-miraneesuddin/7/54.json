    "text": "Your Lord is certainly God Who created the skies and the earth in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe) . He makes the night to cover the day, which (i.e. the day) seeks the (night) rapidly (in succession). And the sun and the moon and the stars are compelled to follow His command. Is not His the creation and he command? Blessed be God the Lord of the worlds"
