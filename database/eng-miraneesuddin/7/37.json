Those are the persons whose portion of (that which is written in) the book (as destiny) will reach them till Our messengers come to them to take them back (at the time of their death), (when) they will say, \"Where are those whom you used to pray to, besides God?\" They will say, \"They have gone away from us,\" and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers"
