Or do you wish to inform Him about (something) which He does not know in the earth? Or (is your polytheism just an) expression of words (and nothing else)?” No! their plans are made to appear fair seeming to those who do not believe and they are turned away from the way, and whom God leaves in error, then for him there is no guide"
