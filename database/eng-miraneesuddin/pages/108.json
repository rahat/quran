And if you are on a journey or one of you comes from the toilet or you have touched women, then, (under the above circumstances) if you do not find water, or if you are sick, then take clean dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God does not intend to put any difficulty on you, but He intends to clean you that He may complete His favour on you so that you may be grateful"
