Those who do not believe, wish that you should be careless of your weapons and your provision, so that they (could) attack you with a single (sudden and united) attack. And there is no sin on you if you lay down your weapons when you are annoyed due to rain or if you are sick, but take your precaution. God has certainly prepared a disgraceful punishment for the disbelievers"
