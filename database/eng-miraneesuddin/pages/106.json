God makes (things) clear for you so that you should not commit a mistake, and God is the Knower of everything"

And when you have removed your pilgrim dress (and are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage) then (you may) hunt. And do not let the hatred of a people who turned you away from the Sacred Mosque (earlier), incite you to exceed the limits. And help one another in righteousness and guarding (against evil) but do not help one another in sin and transgression and fear God, God is certainly severe in requiting (evil)"
