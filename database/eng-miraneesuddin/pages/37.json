And do not take the signs of God for a mockery, and remember the favour of God on you, and that which He has sent down upon you from the book and wisdom to admonish you therewith, and fear God and know that God is the Knower of everything"

And the duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers in recognized (good manner), is upon the father of the child. No one is to be burdened but to the extent of his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child nor a father on account of his child. And (the responsibility) on the heir, is similar to that (which was on the father). But if both desire weaning * by mutual agreement and consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you wish to engage a wet-nurse for your children there is no sin on you, when you pay what is due from you according to the recognised (good procedure), and fear God and know that God is the Seer of whatever you do"
