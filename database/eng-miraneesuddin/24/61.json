    "text": "There is no blame on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor is there blame on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat from your own houses or houses of your fathers or houses of your mothers or houses of your brothers or houses of your sisters or houses of your father's brothers or houses of your father's sisters or houses of your mothers' brothers or houses of your mothers' sisters or (from places) the keys of which are in your control or (from) your friend. There is no sin on you if you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses then greet (by invoking peace) among yourselves, a blessed pleasingly good greeting from God. Thus God makes clear to you the signs that you may understand. (R)"
