    "text": "God directs you concerning your children: For the male a portion equivalent of two females. And if there are more than two females then theirs is two thirds of what is left (to be inherited) and if there is only one, then for her half. And for his parents, for each of them the sixth of what is left behind if he has a child but if he does not have a child and (only) his parents inherit him, then for the mother a third, but if he has brothers then to his mother one sixth after fulfilling the directions of the deceased with which he had directed or (payment of) loan (which he left unpaid); (between) your parents and your children, you do not know which of them is nearer to you in usefulness, (this is an) ordinance from God and God is certainly Knowing, Wise"
