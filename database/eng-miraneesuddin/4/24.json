God has prescribed (this) for you, and lawful for you (to marry) are (all women) other than those mentioned above, provided that you seek them (in marriage) with your wealth, being chaste, not fornicators; then for that which you benefit through the (marriage) from them, give them their appointed dowries, and there is no sin on you about what you mutually agree upon after appointing (the dowries), God is certainly Knowing, Wise"
