    "text": "O owners of the book ! do not commit excesses in your religion, and do not say about God (anything) other than the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the Son of Mary, was only a messenger of God and His word which He communicated to mary and a spirit from Him, so believe in God and His messengers and do not say, \"Three,\" it will be better for you (if) you stop (saying it). God is only One God (and not one of the three as Christians claim). It is far from His Glory that He should have a son for Himself. Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His and God is sufficient as a Trustee"
