    "text": "(There are) those who wait for you, so if you get a victory from God, they say, \"Were we not with you?\" And if the share (of victory) is for the disbelievers, they say (to the disbelievers), \"Did we not have mastery over you and protect you from the believers?\" So God will judge between you on the day of resurrection. And God will not give the disbelievers a way (of dominance) over the believers"
