    "text": "And when you are among them and establish worship (salat) for them then let (only) one party from among them stand with you (for worship) and let the (other party) take their weapons; then when they have prostrated (and finished offering worship) let the (first party) take their positions behind you, and let the other party who did not worship (in the first batch) come (and) then let them worship with you and let the (first party) take their precaution and their weapons. Those who do not believe, wish that you should be careless of your weapons and your provision, so that they (could) attack you with a single (sudden and united) attack. And there is no sin on you if you lay down your weapons when you are annoyed due to rain or if you are sick, but take your precaution. God has certainly prepared a disgraceful punishment for the disbelievers"
