    "text": "Then you are the persons who kill your own people and drive out a party of your people from their houses, supporting one another against them, in sin and transgression, and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, whereas their very driving out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in one part of the book and reject the other part? Then what is the reward of one who does like that among you, except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the day of resurrection * they will be sent towards a severe punishment, and God is not unaware of what you do"
