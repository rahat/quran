    "text": "Did you not consider him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause to die.\" Abraham said, \"Then certainly God causes the sun to rise from the east, so you cause it to rise from the west.\" Thus, he who did not believe was confused. And God does not guide a people who are unjust"
