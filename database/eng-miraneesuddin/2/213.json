    "text": "Human beings were a single community, then God sent prophets as conveyers of good news and as warners and sent down with them the book containing the truth, so that it may (serve as a source of) judgment between human beings in (matters) in which they differed. And none differed there in except those who were given (the book containing prescribed laws), after (receiving) the clear proofs which had come to them, (and this they did) due to mutual envy. So God by His will, guided those who believed, in those (matters in) which they had differed from the truth. And God guides whom He wills towards the straight path"
