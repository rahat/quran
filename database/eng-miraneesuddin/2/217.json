    "text": "They ask you about fighting during the sacred month, say, \"Fighting in it is a great (sin) but turning away (people) from the way of God and disbelief to Him, and (stopping people from) the Sacred Mosque and expelling its people from it are greater (sins) with God. And persecution is a greater (sin) than slaughter.\" And they will not cease fighting with you till they turn you back from your religion if they can, and whosoever from among you turns back from his religion, then dies while he is an disbeliever, then those are the persons whose deeds shall be fruitless in this world and the hereafter, and those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein"
