    "text": "And there is no sin on you in speaking indirectly to ask (such) women in marriage or in keeping such intention to yourselves. God knows that you will mention (it to) them, but do not promise to them in secret except that you speak words recognised (to be good) and do not resolve on the marriage tie, till the prescribed term reaches its end, and know that God knows that which is in your souls, so be cautious of Him and know that God is Protectively Forgiving, Clement (Kind)"
