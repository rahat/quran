    "text": "And when you divorce women and they reach their prescribed term, then either retain them in a recognized (good manner) or let them go in a recognised (good manner), but do not retain them for hurting (them) so that you exceed the limits, and he who does this, has indeed been unjust to his own soul. And do not take the signs of God for a mockery, and remember the favour of God on you, and that which He has sent down upon you from the book and wisdom to admonish you therewith, and fear God and know that God is the Knower of everything"
