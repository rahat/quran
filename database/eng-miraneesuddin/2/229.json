And it is not lawful for you that you should take (back) anything from that which you have given the (women) unless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) God. Then if you fear that they cannot keep within the limits (imposed by) God then there is no sin on both of them if the (woman) ransoms herself. Those are the limits (imposed by) God so do not exceed them and whoever exceeds the limits (imposed by) God then those are the unjust persons. nless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) God.
