    "text": "Those who swallow usury, will rise like one whom the devil has driven to madness by (his) touch, (would) rise. That is because they say, \"Trade is just like usury,\" but God has made trade lawful and prohibited usury. So he to whom the admonition has come from his Lord, if he desists, then for him is what has already passed and his affair is with God; but one returns ( to it ) then those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay in it"
