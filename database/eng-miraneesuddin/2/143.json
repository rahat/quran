    "text": "And thus We have made you a middle community (probably with respect to location and time) that you may be witnesses (by keeping an eye) on mankind and the messenger may be a witness ( by keeping an eye) on you. And We had appointed the Qiblah, towards which you used to (turn earlier), only to know (distinguish) one who follows the messenger, from one who turns away on his heels.
