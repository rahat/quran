    "text": "It is made lawful to you to approach your wives on the night of the fast, they are a garment for you and you are a garment for them, God knew that you were betraying yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and pardoned you, so now (you may) be in contact with them and seek, that which God has prescribed for you, and eat and drink until you can distinguish the white thread of the dawn from the black thread, then complete the fast till the night. And do not be in contact with them (wives) when you devotedly (remain) in the mosques (for Itikaf). These are the limits (imposed by) God, so do not go near them. Thus does God make clear His signs for human beings that they may guard (against evil)"
