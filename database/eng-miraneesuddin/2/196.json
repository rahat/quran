    "text": "And accomplish the pilgrimage (Hajj) and the visit (Umrah) for (the sake of) God, but if you are prevented, then (send) whatever offering is easy to obtain and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination, and whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, then (he should effect a) ransom by fasting or (giving) charity or sacrificing. But when you are safe, then whoever profits by combining the Umrah with the Hajj, then (he should bring with him) whatever offering is easy to obtain, but one who cannot find (anything for offering) should then fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when you return, these (make) ten (days) complete. That is for him whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque. And fear God and know that God is severe in requiting (evil)"
