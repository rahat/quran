And if they are pregnant then spend on them till they lay down their burden, then if they suckle (the child) for you then give them their due payment and consult among yourselves in a recognised (good manner) and if you face some difficulty, then let another (woman) suckle (the child) for him (the responsibility of payment being on the father)"
