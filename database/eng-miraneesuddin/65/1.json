    "text": "O prophet! when you divorce women then divorce them for their prescribed term and calculate the prescribed term and fear God your Lord. Do not drive them out from their houses nor should they themselves go out, unless they commit an open indecency. And those are the limits of God and whoever transgresses the limits of God, he has indeed been unjust to his own soul, you do not know, perhaps God may bring about an event (of reunion) after that"
