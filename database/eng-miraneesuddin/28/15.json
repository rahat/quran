    "text": "And he entered the city when its people were unaware, and found therein two men fighting, one from his sect and the other from his enemies. Then he who was of his sect asked him for help over him who was from his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist thus killing him. He said, “This is an act of the devil, he is certainly an enemy who clearly misleads.”"
