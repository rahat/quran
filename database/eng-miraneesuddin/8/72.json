    "text": "Those who believed and migrated and struggled in the way of God with their wealth and their persons, and those who gave shelter and helped (the immigrants), those are certainly guardians of each other. And those who believed but did not migrate, it is not for you to guard them from anything till they migrate, but if they seek help from you in (the matter of) religion then it is your duty to help them except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and God is a Seer of what you do"
