You see them bowing down, prostrating, seeking grace from God and (His) pleasure, their marks due to the effect of, prostrations are there in their faces. That is their likeness (mentioned) in the Torah and their likeness mentioned in the Gospel. (They are) like vegetation which (first) puts forth its sprout then it becomes firm then it becomes thick, then it stands balanced on its stem, pleasing the sowers, that He may make the disbelievers angry through them. God has promised those among them who believe and do righteous works, protective forgiveness and a great reward"
