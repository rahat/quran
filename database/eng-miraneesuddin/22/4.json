    "text": "O mankind ! if you are in doubt about the resurrection, then We certainly created you from the soil, then from the sperm, then from that which clings and hangs like a leech, then from (a thing like) chewed flesh in proportion and out of proportion . (This description is given so) that We may make clear to you (the process of your birth). And We cause to stay in the wombs that which We will, till an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then (you grow) so as to reach your full strength (of maturity). And among you is he who is caused to die (young), and among you is he who is brought back to (that) worst part of life (i.e. old age), that (even) after having (had) knowledge, he does not know anything. And you see the earth barren, then when We send down water on it, it stirs and swells and puts forth every kind of beautiful growth"
