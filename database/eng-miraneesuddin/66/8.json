    "text": "O you who believe ! turn towards God with sincere repentance, perhaps your Lord will remove from you (the effect of) your evil deeds and make you enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, on the day when God will not disgrace the prophet and those who believed with him, their light will be running before them and on their right hands, they will say, “Our Lord ! perfect our light for us and protectively forgive us, You certainly have power over everything.”"
