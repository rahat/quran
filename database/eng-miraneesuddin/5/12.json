    "text": "And God had indeed taken a pledge from the children of Israel. And We had raised among them twelve chieftains and God had said, \"I am with you if you establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and believe in My messengers and assist them and loan to God a good loan, (then) I will definitely remove from you (the effect of) your evils and I will definitely make you enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow, so whoever among you does not believe after this, he has indeed gone astray (from the) balanced way"
