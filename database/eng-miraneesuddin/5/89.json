    "text": "God will not catch you for that which is vain (unintentional) in your oaths, but He will catch you for the oaths with which you are earnestly tied up. Then for its expiation (so as to wipe off the ill effect of breaking such deliberate oaths you should) feed ten poor persons with the normal food with which you feed your own people or clothe them or set free a slave, but whoever does not find (the means to do any of the above three) then he should fast for three days. That is for the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn, but guard your oaths. Thus God makes clear to you His signs that you may be grateful"
