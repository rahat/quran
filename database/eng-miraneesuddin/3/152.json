    "text": "And God fulfilled His promise to you when you destroyed them with His permission, until when you became weak hearted and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved (booty at battle of Uhad). Among you is one who intends (to receive the benefit in) the world and among you is one who intends (to receive the benefit in) the hereafter. Then He turned you away from them that He might test you and He has pardoned you and God is Gracious to the believers"
