So those in whose hearts is (a desire for) deviation from the right, they follow that which is allegorical in it, seeking to mislead and seeking to interpret it, and no one knows its interpretation except God; and those sound in knowledge say, â€œWe believe in it, all is from our Lord, and no one minds except those who have understanding"
