    "text": "Then after the distress, He sent down on you peaceful slumber (which) covered a party of you, and (another) party, they were anxious themselves, guessing about God (something) other than what was true, a guess of ignorance, saying, \"Is there anything for us in the affair?\" Say, \"The affair, total of it, is certainly God's.\" They were hiding within themselves that which they would not manifest to you, saying, \"Had we any power in the affair, we would not have been slain here.\" Say, \"Even if you had been in your houses, those, for whom slaughter was written, would have certainly gone forth to the places of their death; but (all this happened) because God wanted to test that which was in your bosoms so that He might purify that which was in your hearts. And God is the Knower of that which is in the bosoms"
