    "text": "Believers, do not be like those who are bent on denying the truth and who say of their brothers, when they travel about the land or go forth to war, \"Had they but remained with us, they would not have died, or been slain\" -- for God will cause such thoughts to become a source of bitter regret in their hearts, since it is God who gives life and causes death. And God sees all that you do"
