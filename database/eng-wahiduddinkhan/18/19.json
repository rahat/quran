One of them asked, \"How long have you stayed [here]?\" They said, \"We have stayed a day, or part of a day.\" But others said, \"Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed here. Let one of you go then with these silver coins to the town, and let him find out what food is purest there, and bring you back a supply of it. Let him conduct himself with caution and not disclose your whereabouts to anyone"
