    "text": "Is then He who watches over every soul and its actions [like any other]? Yet they ascribe partners to God. Say, \"Name them! Or do you presume to inform Him of something on the earth of which He does not know? Or, is all this only your verbal assertion?\" Indeed, their devices seem fair to those who deny the truth, and they are kept back from the right path. There can be no guide for those whom God lets go astray"
