    "text": "Recall when your sister walked along and said, \"Shall I guide you to one who will take care of him?\" Thus We returned you to your mother, so that her eyes might be cooled and that she might not grieve. And you killed a man and We delivered you from sorrow. We tested you with various trials. You stayed for a number of years among the people of Midian, then you came upto the standard, Moses"
