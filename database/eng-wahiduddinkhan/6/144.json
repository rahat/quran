    "text": "Again, of the camels there are two, and of the oxen two. Ask them, \"Is it the two males He has forbidden, or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you present when God enjoined this on you?\" Who is more unjust than one who, without knowledge, fabricates a lie against God, so that he may lead people astray without knowledge? Surely, God does not guide the wrongdoers"
