    "text": "Stay well away from an orphan's property, except with the best intentions, before he comes of age. Give full measure and weight, according to justice, We never charge a soul with more than it can bear, when you speak, observe justice, even though it concerns a close relative; and fulfil the covenants of God. That is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may take heed"
