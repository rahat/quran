    "text": "Say, \"Instead of God, shall we call upon that which can neither benefit us nor harm us? Are we to turn upon our heels after God has guided us, like one who, beguiled by devils in the land, wanders bewildered, his companions calling him to the right path, saying, \"Come to us\"?\" Say, \"God's guidance is the only guidance. We are commanded to surrender ourselves to the Lord of the Universe"
