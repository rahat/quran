    "text": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents a lie against God or who says, \"It has been revealed to me,\" while nothing has been revealed to him, or someone who says, \"I will send down the like of what God has sent down\"? If you could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death when the angels are stretching out their hands, saying, \"Give up your souls. Today you will be repaid with a humiliating punishment for saying false things about God and being arrogant about His signs"
