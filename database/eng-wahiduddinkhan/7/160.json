    "text": "We divided them up into twelve tribes, each a whole community, and We revealed Our will to Moses, when his people asked for water, saying, \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Twelve springs gushed from it and each tribe knew its drinking place. We caused the clouds to draw their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quails, saying, \"Eat the good things We have given you.\" They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they wronged"
