Such are the true believers; and such are the God-fearing"

This is an alleviation from your Lord and an act of grace. He who transgresses after this shall have a painful punishment"

Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black. Then resume the fast until nightfall, and do not approach them during the nights of your devotional retreat in the mosques. These are the limits set by God, so do not approach them. Thus He makes clear His commandments to mankind, so that they may guard themselves [against evil]"
