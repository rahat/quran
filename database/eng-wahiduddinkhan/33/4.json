    "text": "God has not placed two hearts in any man's body, nor has He made your wives -- from whom you keep away by saying, \"Be as my mother's back\" -- your [real] mothers, neither He has made your adopted sons as your own sons. These are merely words which you utter with your mouths: but God speaks the truth and gives guidance to the right path"
