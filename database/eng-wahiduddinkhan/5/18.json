    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of God and His beloved ones.\" Say, \"Then why does He punish you for your sins? Indeed, you are but human beings among those He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, belong to God and all shall return to Him"
