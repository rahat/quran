    "text": "When God says, \"Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to people, \"Take me and my mother as two deities besides God\"?\" He will answer, \"Glory be to You! How could I ever say that to which I have no right? If I had ever said so, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my mind, while I do not know anything that is within Yours. You alone are the knower of unseen things"
