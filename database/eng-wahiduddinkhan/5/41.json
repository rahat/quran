    "text": "Messenger, do not be grieved by those who vie with one another in denying the truth; those who say with their tongues, \"We believe,\" but have no faith in their hearts; from among the Jews also, there are those who listen eagerly to any lies. They listen to you to convey to others [religious leaders] who do not come to you [out of pride and conceit]. They [these leaders] take words out of their context and say, \"If this be given to you, receive it, but if not, then beware!\" If anyone's trial is intended by God, you cannot in the least prevail against God on his behalf. Those whose hearts God does not intend to purify shall be subjected to disgrace in this world and a severe punishment in the Hereafter"
