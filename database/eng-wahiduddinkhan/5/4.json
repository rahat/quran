    "text": "If they ask you what has been made lawful for them, say, \"All good things have been made lawful for you;\" and what you have taught your birds and beasts of prey to catch, training them as God has taught you. So eat what they catch for you, but first pronounce God's name over it. Fear God, for God is swift in taking account"
