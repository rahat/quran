Thus many partners wrong one another -- [all] save those who believe [in God] and do righteous deeds: but how few are they!\" And [suddenly] David understood that We were only putting him to the test, and so he asked his Lord to forgive him his sins; he fell to his knees, and turned to Him in repentance"
