    "text": "Those who live on usury shall rise up before God like men whom Satan has demented by his touch; for they say, \"Buying and selling is only a kind of usury.\" But God has made trade lawful and made usury unlawful. Therefore, he who desists because of the admonition that has come to him from his Lord may retain what he has received in the past; and it will be for God to judge him. Those who revert to it shall be the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever"
