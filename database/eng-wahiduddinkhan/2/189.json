    "text": "They ask you about the phases of the moon. Say, \"They are a means of determining time for the regulation of people's affairs and for the pilgrimage.\" Piety does not consist in entering your houses from the rear. Indeed, one who guards himself against evil out of fear of God is the truly righteous one. Enter your houses by their doors and be mindful of God, so that you may prosper"
