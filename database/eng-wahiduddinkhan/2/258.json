    "text": "Have you not heard of him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had bestowed the kingdom upon him? Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and brings death.\" He answered, \"I [too] give life and bring death!\" Abraham said, \"God brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up yourself from the west.\" Then the disbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoers"
