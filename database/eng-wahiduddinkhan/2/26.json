    "text": "God does not disdain to give a parable about a gnat or a smaller creature. The faithful know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who deny the truth ask, \"What could God mean by this parable?\" He lets many go astray through it, and guides many by it. But He makes only the disobedient go astray"
