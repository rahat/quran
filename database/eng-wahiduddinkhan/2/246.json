They said, \"Appoint for us a king, and we will fight for the cause of God.\" He replied, \"What if you refuse to fight, when ordered to do so?\" \"Why should we not fight for the cause of God,\" they replied, \"when we have been driven forth from our homes and our children?\" But when at last they were commanded to fight, they all refused, except a few of them. God knows the wrongdoers"
