    "text": "Believers, do not approach your prayers when you are drunk, until you understand what you say, nor when you are in a state of impurity, -- except when you are on a journey -- till you have bathed. And if you are ill, or on a journey or have relieved yourselves or when you have consorted with women and you cannot find any water, then find some clean sand and wipe your face and your hands with it. God is gracious and forgiving"
