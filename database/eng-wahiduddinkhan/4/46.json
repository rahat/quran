    "text": "Some Jews take words out of their context and say, \"We have heard, but we disobey,\" or \"Hear without listening.\" And they say \"Look at us,\" twisting the phrase with their tongues so as to disparage religion. But if they had said, \"We hear and we obey,\" and \"Listen to us and look at us with favour,\" that would have been better and more proper for them. God has rejected them for their defiance so that they shall not believe, except a few of them"
