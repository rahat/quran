    "text": "Have you not seen those to whom it was said, \"Restrain your hands, say your prayers and pay the prescribed alms?\" And when they have been ordered to fight, some of them have felt afraid of human beings just as they should be afraid of God, or they are even more afraid. They say, \"Our Lord, why have You ordered us to fight? If You would only postpone it for a little while longer!\" Say, \"The benefits of this world are negligible and the Hereafter will be better for one who fears God; and you shall not be wronged in the slightest"
