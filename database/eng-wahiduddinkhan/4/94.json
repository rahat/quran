    "text": "Believers, when you go forth in the cause of God, make due investigation and do not say to those who offer you the greeting of peace, \"You are no believer!\" because you seek the good things of this life. With God there are good things in plenty. You yourself were in the same position before, but God conferred His special favour on you. Therefore, take care to investigate. Surely God is well-aware of what you do"
