    "text": "A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said, \"Would you slay a man merely because he says, \"My Lord is God.\" He has brought you clear signs from your Lord, and if he is lying, the sin of his will be on his own head; but if he is truthful, a part of that of which he warns you will surely befall you. Certainly, God does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar"
