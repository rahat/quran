Would you show them affection when they have rejected the truth you have received; when they have driven you and the Messenger out [simply] because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have left your homes to strive for My cause and out of a desire to seek My goodwill, how can you secretly offer them friendship? I know all that you conceal and all that you reveal. Whoever of you does this will surely stray from the right path"

Enmity and hatred shall endure between us and you, until you believe in the one God.\" [The exception was] when Abraham said to his father, \"I shall indeed pray for [God\"s] forgiveness for you; although I do not have it in my power to obtain anything from God on your behalf.\" They prayed, \"O our Lord, in You we have placed our trust and to You we turn in repentance and to You is the final return"
