By it the prophets who were obedient to Us judged the Jews, and so did the rabbis and the priests, according to God's Book which had been entrusted to their care; and to which they were witnesses. Have no fear of man; fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a paltry sum. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are deniers of truth"

But, if anyone forgoes it, this shall be for him an expiation. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are wrongdoers"
