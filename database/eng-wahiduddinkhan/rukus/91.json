They [these leaders] take words out of their context and say, \"If this be given to you, receive it, but if not, then beware!\" If anyone's trial is intended by God, you cannot in the least prevail against God on his behalf. Those whose hearts God does not intend to purify shall be subjected to disgrace in this world and a severe punishment in the Hereafter"
