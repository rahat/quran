Say to them, \"All is in the hands of God.\" They conceal in their hearts what they would not reveal to you. They say, \"Had we had any say in the matter, none of us would have been killed here.\" Say to them, \"Had you stayed in your homes, those whose death had been decreed would nevertheless have gone forth to the places where they were destined to die.\" And all this befell you so that God might test what is in your minds. And in order to purify what was in your hearts. For God is aware of your innermost thoughts"
