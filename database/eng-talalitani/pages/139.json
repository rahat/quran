And you were taught what you did not know—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, “God;” then leave them toying away in their speculation"

If only you could see the wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the angels with arms outstretched: “Give up your souls. Today you are being repaid with the torment of shame for having said about God other than the truth, and for being too proud to accept His revelations.”"
