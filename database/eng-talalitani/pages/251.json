Say, “God is the Creator of all things, and He is The One, the Irresistible.”"

And from what they heat in fire of ornaments or utensils comes a similar froth. Thus God exemplifies truth and falsehood. As for the froth, it is swept away, but what benefits the people remains in the ground. Thus God presents the analogies"

Those will have the worst reckoning; and their home is Hell—a miserable destination"
