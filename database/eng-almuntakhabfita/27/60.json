    "text": "Ask them: \"Who was He Who created the heavens and the earth and caused rain water to fall from the floor of the vault of heaven to serve as the means of causing beautiful orchards to grow, an action proper to Allah alone! If you people had tried hard to cause the trees* thereof to grow you would have utterly failed. Is this not an action distinctly and exclusively peculiar to Allah! Or is it to a god incorporated with Him! Yet they are a people who ignorantly and impudently place the objects they worship -false gods- on an equality with Allah"
