    "text": "He -Ya'qub- in a word with grace divine imbued, advised his sons ,\" not to make entry through the same gate. He said to them: \" O my sons, do not all enter by the same gate but segregate yourselves from one another and enter by different gates. Not that I will deprecate a misfortune that Allah has meant to befall you, it is not in mortals to command success.\" \"Allah is He Who has the command; in Him do I trust and in Him must all the faithful put their trust"
