    "text": "Our Messengers O Muhammad do face hardships and difficulties, adversities and distresses to the extent that they give up hope of their followers' constancy and begin to think that they take them for impostors. There and then the turning point is reached and Our help comes in good time. We deliver whom We will and punish whom We will and never is Our retributive punishment averted from those who grow daily more and more wicked"
