    "text": "He is it Who exhibits to view the lightening -the electrical discharges between groups of clouds or between the clouds and the ground- which actuate you people with the feeling of fear. It might bring suffering, strike one dead or engender a cyclonic storm. Also with the feeling of hope of rainfalls to revive the land that has been pined with drought- and He is it Who engenders the thick clouds, the cumulus and the cumulus nimbus"
