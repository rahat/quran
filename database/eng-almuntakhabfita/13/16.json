    "text": "Ask them O Muhammad: \"Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth!\" and say to them: \"It is Allah\". and ask them: \"Have you taken besides Him other deities who have no control over what befalls You of good or harm!\". Ask them: \"Do you compare the one without the sense of sight or who lacks spiritual perception with the other who perceives objects by sight or perceives mentally and apprehends by thought ! \" \"Does darkness or want of spiritual or intellectual sight compare with light or spiritual enlightenment?\". Or did those whom they incorporate with Allah call into existence or form out of nothingness any creature, animate or inanimate, identical with any of those created by Allah, to the extent that they cannot tell the difference! Say to them: \"It is Allah Who is the Creator of the whole and of all in all; He is the One and only Ilah, the Supreme controlling and influencing power inherent in the whole and in all in all"
