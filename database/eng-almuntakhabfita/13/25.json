    "text": "Those who do not fulfill their covenant with Allah after they have solemnly vowed to Him to do what has been enjoined, disjoining humanity and policy instead of joining them, separating the two hands joining one another in fidelity, disjoining all that Allah has ordained be joined together and making mischief on earth or creating discord were born to be losers. These and such persons have come within the measure of Allah 's wrath, and in their final abode they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering"
