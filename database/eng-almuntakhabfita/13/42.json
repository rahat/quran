    "text": "Their predecessors schemed and conspired and the wicked plotted against the just, but who can get the better of Allah's plans or defeat His predetermined events? He is the Master Who controls all plans at will. He has omniscience and holds prescience of all that each soul earns of qualities, actions and deeds, The day shall come when the infidels realize with much regrets to whom belongs eternity in the heavenly and blissful abode"
