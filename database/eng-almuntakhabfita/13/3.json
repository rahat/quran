    "text": "He is it Who extended the earth spreading it out and therein He placed mountains in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, and rivers with copious streams of fresh water flowing in channels, and of all and each fruit did He produce a pair, male and female -with stamens and pistils, uni and bisexual. He enshrouded the day with the veil of the night. Indeed here, there and everywhere are signs with prodigies emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority sensed by those who consider matters and ponder their cause"
