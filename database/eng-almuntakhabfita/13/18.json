    "text": "Those who respond favourably to Allah, the Creator, and lift to Him their inward sight are the recipients of Allah's blessings and gratifying rewards, whereas those who do not respond and their hearts dare rise defiant against Him were born to be losers. If they have profuse affluence of all things on earth and twice as much, they would gladly give it in expiation of their guilt at Judgment, but far from it. These and their like must expect a manifest discomfort of body and mind. Much misery and hardship shall be the insignia of their reckoning when the account of their life and conduct is rendered at Judgment. Their abode is Hell and evil indeed is the bed they have made for themselves"
