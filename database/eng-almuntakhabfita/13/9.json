    "text": "He is Omniscient of what the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of what they forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what is conversed secretly and uttered below the breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed and with all that is uttered loudly and with all that is being said. He is uniquely and imposingly the Great and He is infinitely far above the whole and all in all"
