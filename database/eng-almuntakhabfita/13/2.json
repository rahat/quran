    "text": "Allah, the Omnipotent, is He Who raised the heavens with its spheres lying above or outside of each other inlaid with heavenly bodies superstructures that are kept aloft without pillars or visible means* of support that you people can see, then set He Himself on the Throne of Supremacy and dominion, of grace and mercy, and reduced the sun** and the moon to a state of subserviency. Each describing its orbit for a determined period of time. He conducts all affairs and expounds His revelations and clearly displays His cosmic signs to the mind and renders His discourse readily understood so that you people may hopefully realize that you shall inevitably assemble before Him, at the predetermined point of time"
