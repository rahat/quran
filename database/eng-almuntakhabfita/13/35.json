    "text": "To represent in words the Paradise promised those who lift to Allah their inward sight, it is the Garden of bliss and delight, of protection, security and peace of mind beneath which rivers flow. Its fruits and its glory are eternal and therein they will have passed through nature to eternity of joy. This is the destination of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, whereas the intended end of those who deny Him is the fire of Hell"
