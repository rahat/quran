    "text": "A Quran personified in a Prophet who features the spirit of truth and the grace of Allah expressing and elucidating to you its expounded revelations in order to guide you into all truth, and to conduct those, whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds of wisdom and piety from want of spiritual or intellectual sight into enlightenment and illumination. Allah shall welcome them into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow; wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity; and be graced with the bounty of Providence"
