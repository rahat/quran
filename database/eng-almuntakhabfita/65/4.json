    "text": "And those of your women who have renounced the hope of experiencing their menstrual courses again, and you are in doubt of the date or of the nature of the discharge, then they have to wait for a set period of three months. A similar set period is obligatory to those who have not yet experienced these periodic courses. As for those who are in process of gestation, their set period accords with the duration of the pregnancy and ends when they have been relieved of their burden; and he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful Allah, will Allah facilitate his task and lead him to a facile and useful life"
