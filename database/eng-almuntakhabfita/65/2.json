    "text": "When the set period is near fulfillment, you either hold together in honour and in each other's regard crowned with equity, or part in honour and equity. In either case you must bring two of your people, who are known to recourse to general principles of justice, who lift to Allah their inward sight, to bear witness to the final decision and resolution, be it divorce or reunion. This discourse is an exhortation to those who believe with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and their wisdom is consumed in confidence of the Day of Judgment. And he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful Allah, shall Allah be his very present help in trouble"
