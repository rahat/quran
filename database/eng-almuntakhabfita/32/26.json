    "text": "Do they not perceive mentally and by sight the significance of Allah's penalties! and have they failed to realize how many generations before them did We reduce into a useless form!

Indeed, such an outcome is emblematic of Allah's signs recognized by people of insight. Are they deaf or have their hearts' ears been closed"
