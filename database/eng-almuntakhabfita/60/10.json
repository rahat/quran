    "text": "O you whose hearts reflect he image of religious and spiritual virtues: If women come to you emigrating or seeking refuge owing to religious persecution or political troubles, test their beliefs; Allah knows well if the image of Faith has been imprinted upon their hearts. if you are satisfied that they believe in Allah with bosoms filled with reverential awe, do not send them back to the Pagans. They -the women are no longer legitimate to them nor are they -the Pagan men- any longer legitimate to them. But you must pay their -Pagan- husbands the equivalent of what they had spent on them in the way of dowry. You are absolved to marry these women if you pay them their dower and do not marry the Pagan women nor remain with them if you have conformed to Islam and they have not, but you may ask for what you spent and so can Pagan men ask for what they spent. This is the ordinance of Allah; He judges between you, and He is Alimun (Omniscient), and Hakimun (Wise)"
