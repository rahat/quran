    "text": "Had We sent down angels whom they could perceive by sight and resurrected for them the dead to discourse with them practical divinity, and thronged before their eyes, beings, matters and affairs of the spiritual world, they would not have acknowledged the truth nor would they have conformed to Islam unless it be the will of Allah. But most of them are so ignorant to realize this fact"
