    "text": "And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth, Who alone has the rightful claim to reverence and veneration featured in the act of worship and in displaying the appropriate acts and rites. He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that you converse secretly or whisper under your breath and of what you suggest, secretly to the mind, of all that your breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of all that you utter. Furthermore, He is 'Alimun of all that you earn of qualities, actions and deeds"
