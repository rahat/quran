And no soul imprints its deed with piety or with evil but it is to its own credit or discredit respectively, nor shall a soul bearing wrongs or not, bear the wrong of another, then back to Allah, your Creator, you are all destined to go. There and then shall He inform you of the detailed particulars of all the points upon which the whole unreasoning turned"
