    "text": "And do not oblige the rich infidels who suffer from inordinate self-esteem, by dismissing those who are humble in rank or station before they listen to your discourse on Islam. Poor as they are, they uplift their hands and their inward sight to Allah in their devotional exercise morning and evening seeking only the illumination proceeding from Him, featured in the language spoken by His countenance. You are not accountable O Muhammad to Allah for their deeds or actions, nor are they accountable to Allah for your deeds or actions to induce you to dismiss them and be wrongful of action"
