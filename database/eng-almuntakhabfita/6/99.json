    "text": "And it is He Who sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain-water and with it do We cause vegetal activity of all -plants-*. And We prompt the green blades to spring up and develop into clusters of ears of grain which ripen and be brought to maturity. And out of the palm trees commanding a view of all that lies around, hang pinnate of fan shaped leaves and sprouting offshoots of variegated and delightful fruits. And of the fruit trees are orchards of grapes, olives and pomegranates besides similar species and -Common characteristics- and dissimilar genus -class or distinct group-. Direct you people your intellectual eye and your inward sight to the fruit trees when they bloom and put forth blossoms and when the flowers come to be fruits which grow ripe, and you shall find enough tokens representing convincing divine evidence symbolic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, giving insight to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand"
