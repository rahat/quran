    "text": "Indeed, those who broke the unity of their religion and separated it into parts in fact and in thought, in opinion and in feeling and in interest and set themselves at variance shall have much to answer for; you are not a part of them nor have you a personal relation with them nor will you be responsible for the way they conduct themselves in life. Their account rests with Allah Who shall inform them in Day of Judgement of all that they perpetrated of wrong doings"
