    "text": "And who is more wrongful than him who relates falsehood to Allah and attributes to Him every falsity that could be devised, or claims that he has been inspired by Allah when in fact nothing whatsoever has been inspired to him! And who is more wicked than him who says: I am able to produce a book the like of that sent down by Allah! If only you Muhammad could see the wicked at the distressful moment of death when they are in agony, of mind and soul, as the angels of death put forward their hands to disembody their souls and say to them: \"Now is the moment to surrender your souls \"Today you shall suffer the humiliating torment laid upon the damned for attributing to Him nothing but falsehood and for turning your heads in contempt objecting to His signs and revelations with inordinate self-esteem"
