    "text": "Nonetheless, he whom Allah wills to guide to His path of righteousness, He comforts him with strange and mystical feelings and makes his breast -the seat of affections and emotions - amenable and responsive to the joyful thought of conforming to Islam. But he whom Allah decides to leave to his evil thoughts, He tightens his reins in despair and tightens his chest so as to be rendered impervious to a breath of spiritual knowledge; a feeling similar to that he experiences if he were climbing skywards to high altitudes*. Thus does Allah afflict those who deny Him with the torment laid on the damned"
