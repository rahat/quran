    "text": "He is it Who created the heavens and the earth in truth and with a set of invariable cosmic laws in all manner of wisdom and for a valid reason. The instant He says to an object or to an event \"Be\" it is there. His Word is the truth personified and to Him belong the absolute sovereignty and the full control of the Eventful Event when the trumpet is sounded indicative of Resurrection and Judgement. He is the Omniscient of the invisible, the hidden and the unseen, the Omniscient of what the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of what they forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what you converse secretly and utter below your breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed, with all that is uttered loudly and with all that is being said. He is Al Hakim (he Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations) and AL-Khabir (The Omniscient)"
