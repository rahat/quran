    "text": "Thus did We apply to every Prophet enemies characterized with Satanic attributes among both mankind and the Jinn who actuate each other with the feeling of confidence pertaining to fair-spoken discourse with implication of deceit. Had Allah willed they would never have dwelled on such settled behaviour as representative of feeling or opinion nor lingered round it. Therefore, let them sink under the vexations of their thoughtless minds and befool the minds and judgement of the people so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true"
