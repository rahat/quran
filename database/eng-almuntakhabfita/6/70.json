    "text": "And dismiss O Muhammad from your thoughts those who do not justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will and treat it mockingly and amuse themselves with its principles pinning it ostentatiously to their sleeves. They are deceived by the sensuous enjoyment they regarded as the chief object of life. But put them in mind of the truth, it may hopefully bring them to their senses and they come to realize that every soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and shall have no tutelary protector besides Allah. Nor shall humble intercession be accepted from any on behalf of another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of the one or the other. These persons of common attributes, qualities and actions shall be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds. Their uneasy and painful sensation of thirst shall only be quenched with boiling water and they shall suffer the torment laid on the damned who grew daily more and more wicked, intentionally denying the truth and asserting falsehood"
