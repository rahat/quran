    "text": "Do they purpose to wait until some fitting event presents itself and they distinctly perceive the angels or perceive Allah, your Creator, Himself by sight or. Some of His signs evincing both His Omnipotence and the truth of your mission! But when such overwhelming signs present themselves, no soul which did not surrender itself earlier to Allah's Authority nor accomplished a useful purpose in virtue of its faith, shall profit of its submission now. Say to them: \"Await the justice prepared above in heaven's realm and we will await it also"
