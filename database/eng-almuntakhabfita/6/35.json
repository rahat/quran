    "text": "If their natural aversions and antipathies perturb you, and you are able to excavate a roadway underground or set up a ladder to ascend heavenward to bring about a sign to convince them of the truth of your mission, then by all means do it. Had Allah willed He would have united their thoughts and feelings to meditate reverence and obedience to Him and seek His guidance and spiritual union. Therefore, do not be one of those destitute of Allah's knowledge"
