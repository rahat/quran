    "text": "Say to them O Muhammad: \"Is it befitting to invoke besides Allah mortals, immortals or figures made of stone or wood, when none of them can afford us help nor is it in their capacity to do us harm, and we be so ignorant to depreciate the spirit of truth guiding into all truth!\" And is it wise to turn on our heels and reverse our natural instinct which manifests itself in rational acts after we have received divine enlightenment and illumination and the world is all before us and Providence our guide! \"If so, we would stand similitude exact of someone who has been befooled by the Satanic, who wanders over the earth without rest perplexed in its enormous extent, not directed by reason or a fixed purpose, and in quest, he knows not of what, unknowing where his course is bound! \"Influenced by the Satanic, he hardly hears the call of his good and pious friends begging him to come back to them and urge peace with Allah and reconcile himself with his own heart and with Allah\". Say to them; \"it is, only the course steered by Allah that leads to the path of righteousness where Providence is the guide and we Muslims have been commanded to conform our will to Allahâ€™s will"
