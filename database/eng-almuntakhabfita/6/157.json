    "text": "Or you may say: \"Had we received their Book we would have regarded with more reverence and veneration, and in all things we would have conformed our will to Allah's will and we would have regarded His way but the one way of arriving at the truth\". Now, there has come to you a convincing evidence of the truth of Our Messenger's mission and with him has come the Quran with illumination and enlightenment and a spirit of truth guiding into all truth and inviting Allah's mercy. Therefore, who is more wicked than he who denies Allah's revelations and signs and counsels deaf to Allah's disclosure of divine knowledge and spiritual enlightenment! Indeed, those who counsel deaf to Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority shall be put to the torment laid upon the damned in requital of closing their hearts, ears and their mindsâ€™ eyes to intellectual and spiritual enlightenment"
