    "text": "Say to them O Muhammad: \"I do not find among the divine ordinances inspired to me an act prohibiting an article of food consumed by mankind unless it be, a permitted animal found dead â€“carrion- or blood streaming from an animal or the flesh of swine; this is impure and unclean food. There is also the permitted animal slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than that of Allah. But under compelling circumstances and not in transgression shall Allah admit of relaxation; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
