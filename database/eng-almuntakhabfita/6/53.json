We gathered the rich and the poor together to try them and expose the inclination of the one in the presence of the other. And there contemptuously, said the rich who were extravagant in their accounts of themselves: \"Is it these whom Allah has graced among us!\" Does Allah not know best the thankful who are actuated with the feeling of gratitude"
