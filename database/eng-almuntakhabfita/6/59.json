    "text": "And with Him are kept the keys serving to open up, disclose and explain the unknown, the mysterious and the obscure which no one knows but Him. He has omniscience of all that is on the land and in the sea, and not one single leaf, large or small, laterally produced from a stem or a branch, or springing from its root that falls, but comes to His knowledge. Nor a seed embedded in the darkness of the interior of the earth nor anything fresh, or moist, green or dry, withered or solid, but is inscribed and made manifest in a Book"
