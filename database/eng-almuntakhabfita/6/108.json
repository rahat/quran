    "text": "Do not assail those who incorporate with Allah other deities nor their idols with abusive language conveying injurious reproach lest they should revile Allah in retaliation by want of thought. Thus did We allure every nation acting upon a given belief to brighter present and happier destiny, then back to Allah, their Creator, all are destined to go, there and then shall He inform them of all that their minds and souls had impelled them to do"
