They said: \"Never did Allah disclose divine knowledge to a human being nor did He admit discourse directly or indirectly to His Omnipotence and Authority\". Ask them; \"Who then had sent down the Book you knew that Mussa presented to his people, the Book flowing forth with illumination and enlightenment to illuminate the intellect of mankind; the Book the Jews divided and again broke up into subdivisions and published the parts they planned to disclose and concealed the many parts which would publish their shame and their immorality; the Book which imparted to them divine knowledge and acquainted them intellectually with facts neither they nor their fathers had ever known\". \"Is it not Allah!\" Let them Muhammad drown themselves in the nonsensical and engage in amusement which is the happiness of those who cannot think. * The Meccan Infidels and the Jews"
