    "text": "Furthermore, infanticide - mainly females, occasionally a male - was imposed by the Satanic mediators as a religious rite which allured many of them to brighter worlds; a plan devised by the priests and the satanic to demoralize them and induce them to perfect their own ruin and throw their idolism into confusion. Had Allah willed they would not have indulged in such an evil practice. Therefore let them O Muhammad sink under the vexations of their thoughtless minds and befool the minds and the judgement of the people so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true"
