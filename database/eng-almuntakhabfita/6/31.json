    "text": "Losers indeed are those who deny Resurrection and their audience of Allah, their Creator. And when all of a sudden the predetermined Eventful Hour surprises them, they shall say with pining regrets and vain repentances: \"It is a great pity to have neglected our duty to Allah in life below and for what we left undone.\" They shall be burdened with wrongs more then their backs can bear. Evil indeed is the fate of those who are burdened with wrongs, and evil indeed are the wrongs they wear"
