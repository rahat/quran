            "text": "Allah, your Creator knows that you (Muhammad) and some of those who follow you, engage in the act of worship and meditation, at times, close to two thirds of the night or half the night and other times one third of it to ponder the Revelation. Allah determines the duration of the night and the day; He knew you would not be able to determine the course He prescribed and ordained, and so He gave so merciful a turn to you. Therefore, read of the Quran as much as will put you at ease. He knows that among you there will be those who are suffering from illness, others journeying the land to seek Allah's bounty and others fighting in His cause. Therefore, read of it - the Quran - as much as will put you at ease, and perform your prayers and give alms, for alms are but the vehicles of prayer. Also lend Allah all you can of your benevolence, and whatever you advance of piety toward future security, you shall find it in heaven's realm of such a value that it reimburses you what is indeed profitable and really rewarding and invoke Allah's forgiveness; Allah is indeed Ghaforun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)"
