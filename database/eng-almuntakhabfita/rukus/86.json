Commandments expressed by Allah represent His will relative to the conduct of His intelligent creatures. Thus, Allah rendered lawful the flesh of camels, cows, sheep and the live animals reared for food excepting those designated forbidden. Nor are you permitted to chase wild animals or game while you are on pilgrimage -major or minor- nor in the environs of the Sacrosanct Mosque. Allah ordains what He will"

And when you have concluded the proceedings of Allah’s religious rites and divested yourselves of the pilgrim's garb and moved away from the environs of the Sacrosanct House, you may engage in the chase if you like. And let not your hatred of a people, once your enemies who malevolently obstructed your way to the Sacrosanct House, stir your emotions to retaliate. And unite in good will to effectuate moral virtue and piety and not in sin, transgression and impiety, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Who punishes severely"

And you are forbidden to divide meat among you by divination and raffling by arrows, this is indeed impiety. This day have the infidels lost hope of alienating you from Allah’s purpose and divine principles, Therefore, do not fear them but fear Me. Today have I complemented for you your religion and made all grace abound in you. And I have chosen for you Islam as the acceptable system of faith and worship But he who is forced, by reason of hunger and want of lawful food, to eat of the forbidden, and not by willful transgression of Allah’s commandments nor does disobedience reside in the intention, shall find Allah Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)"

And those who reject faith shall their hopes be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter where they shall be among the great losers"
