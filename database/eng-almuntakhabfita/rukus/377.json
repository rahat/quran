Allah misguides indeed whom He will and guides to His path of righteousness whom He will. Therefore, do not let yourself O Muhammad be affected with grief and deep sorrow for their irreverent response to the divine message nor should you lament their deviation from sense with sighing Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient indeed of all that they do)"
