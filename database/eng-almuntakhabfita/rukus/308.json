Other than these particular periods you are absolved and so are they to move freely and to come round -in an informal way- attending to each other. Thus does Allah distinctly express to you people His revelations guiding you to the proper way of life relative to moral conduct. Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun"

However, if they conform their life and conduct to the principles of morality and use their outer garment, it is much better for them and may guard them against temptation and from being supposed.
