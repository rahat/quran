On every occasion when they lost some of their fellow countrymen in journeys of trade or in wars, they expressed their thoughts in words: \"Had they been with us and remained here, they would not have died nor been slain.\" This feeling and thought did Allah infuse into them to actuate their hearts and minds with grief. It is Allah who gives life and occasions the moment of death and He is 'Alimun of all that you do"

Had you been unsparing in censure and reproof and harsh hearted, they would have broken the bonds of loyalty and would have broken away from you. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy and consult with them upon matters of great moment, matters on which you received no divine authoritative instructions. So when you have caused a discord to pass into a concord and resolved on a course of action, then in Allah you trust, for Allah likes those who put their trust in Him"
