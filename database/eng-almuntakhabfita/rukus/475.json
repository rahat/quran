They were expected to please Allah with the profound reverence dutiful to Him and with deeds reflecting wisdom and piety and striving in His cause to attain His purpose. Yet when We made Monasticism come to pass, they never regarded the principle with close attention nor did they foster it as they should. And so We gave those of them, whose hearts Reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety the reward they merited; many among them were indeed wicked"
