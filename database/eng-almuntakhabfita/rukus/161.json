Have you come to be worldly - minded and content with life here afore that Hereafter! But how little are the material and the immaterial things that minister to enjoyment and content here as compared with Hereafter"

Prompted by Allah and actuated by divine influence he left home with no one but his companion* to whom he was his second. In the cave** where they both hid, He said to his companion: Rest assured and do not grieve; we are not two but three; Allah is in our presence There and then did Allah inspire peace and tranquility as well as just confidence to the heart and mind of His Messenger and the thoughts were conveyed to one another, and He upheld him and supported him with an invisible array of angels. There, did Allah make what the infidels had forged in their breasts to what their tongues have vented fail to accord. Thus, was what they declared in words debased and the Word of Allah, supreme and dominant, is as always at the top; Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun"

Every hand must be open to contribute something to the common purpose, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, a continuous series of operations constituting the whole. Such a campaign is to your advantage if only you knew. It kills the attempt your enemy has made to shake the dominion Allah intends to establish, it makes the final victory sit on your helm and brings you peace of mind and it helps you prevail and confirm Allah's system of faith and worship"

They are the cause of their own destruction, and Allah knows that they are liars"
