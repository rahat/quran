And when they are in council with him on a matter of common interest they do not break off individually or in toto until they have been excused. Those of them who ask your permission O Muhammad under the circumstances are indeed true and sincere in their recognition of Allah and His Messenger. Therefore, should they ask your permission to leave for a valid reason, then you may excuse whom you will and invoke on their behalf Allah's forgiveness; Allah is indeed is Ghafurun and Rahimun"

Allah is fully aware of those of you who slip away quietly from the assemblies screening themselves behind others. Those who transgress the Messenger's command or willfully neglect it had better know that he who disobeys the Messenger disobeys Allah and by consequence may Allah close their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes or He may wed them to a calamity here and punish them severely Hereafter"
