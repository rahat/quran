Some were in favour of obeying the Prophet's command and maintaining their posts and the others against his command, running after booty, at a time when the Prophet was about to make the victory. Among you are those who are concerned only with the interests and pleasures of life below and its mundane things, and others whose main concern is Allah’s grace Hereafter. Then did Allah distract your minds and your attention and made you draw off from the battle field to test your true inclination and He afforded you forgiveness. Allah’s bounty abounds in those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"

Others were aroused to emotion, which begot unjust suspicion of Allah, and a state of mind characteristic of ignorance - analogous to the ignorance induced by paganism. The latter keep their thoughts to themselves and do not express them to you O Muhammad and they say to themselves: \"If we had a say in the matter we would never have been slain here in battle!\" Say to them: \"Had you decided to be the stay- at- home, those of you predestined to be slain would have emerged to the sites of their interment.\" Such a train of events, Allah has ordained to expose your actions interpreting your thoughts, and to test your innermost being for such a disposition as your hearts and minds would incline you to propound. Allah is 'Alimun of all that is stored in the bosoms"
