Allah takes the matters of fact He knows and you do not, and circumstances them in His own manner and He accorded you besides Hodaibyiah quite a near event"

A Quran serving as the criterion and the canon wherein Providence is the guide; it aligns and makes unanimous the course of action, of thought and of life of all concerned, Muslims and Non Muslims whose religious practices are contingent upon man - made related aspects of the one religion whose unclouded and authoritative front is Islam; and good enough for you people is this testimony on the part of Allah"

Their countenances bear evidence of prostrating their reason to Divine Revelation and their looks are bright, beaming with hope. This is the product of a sequence of events portrayed as such in the graphic appearance described thus early in AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and AL-Injil (the Bible). It is a picture standing similitude exact of a seed which began to spring, putting forth its stalk which grew stronger and stronger. It supported leaves, flowers and fruits, displaying a spectacular and imposing situation distressing those who deny Allah and throwing them into mental disorder and discomposure. To those of them, whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds of wisdom and piety, has Allah promised a gracious reward"
