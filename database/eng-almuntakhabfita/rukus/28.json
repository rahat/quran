Say to them: \"Fighting during the Sacred Month is a grave offence and obstruction to Allah’s spirit of truth guiding people into all truth and an emphatic denial of the Sacred Mosque and the month's sanctity. And expulsion of Allah’s devotees from whence is a major offence to Allah and persecution for creed or opinion is worse than murder. The idolaters will continue to fight you until they succeed in forcing you to renounce your religion if they can. And he who turns renegade among you and dies captivated in disbelief and such persons shall be inherent losers; their hope shall be disappointed and their deeds shall be worthless here and Hereafter; it is these who shall be claimed by Hell and therein shall they remain forever"
