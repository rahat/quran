Nor, even though they desire to harm you, can they get you into harm's way. Allah has revealed to you the Book -the Quran- to guide you and acquaint your heart with wisdom and He imparted to you the knowledge of what you at no time knew, and Allah's grace and blessings on you have been indeed abounding"

And he whose lines of character are broad and clear as to feature willingness to comply with divine principles for the sake of piety shall be a recipient of Allah's grace; We will requite him with a great reward"
