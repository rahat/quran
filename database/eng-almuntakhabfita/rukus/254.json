Meantime send one of you with this silver coin to town in quest of the best food and he brings back some of it to satisfy our hunger, but he must be gentle and courteous and not to attract attention or fix directly upon himself nor indirectly upon you the notice of others"

Others will say: \"Five, their dog the sixth\", an exercise of divination, whereas others will say: \"Seven, their dog the eighth\". Say to them O Muhammad: \"Allah, my Creator, knows best their number; it is only a few who have been given the knowledge of the number and the significance of the even\". Therefore, do not involve yourself O Muhammad in the heat of their dispute but treat the subject from an objective standpoint only so as to exhibit the actual facts and never seek counsel from any of them upon the event"
