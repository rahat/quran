And he has already bought you clear evidence demonstrating Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and brings you to your senses! And if he happens to be lying and conveying a false impression he will only much hurt himself and his interest and the fault will be at his own door But if what he says is in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality then you shall be wed to some of the calamities he has promised you anal you will have brought suffering upon yourselves\". Allah certainly does not guide to His path of righteousness any one who goes beyond just and prescribed limits and lies in his teeth"
