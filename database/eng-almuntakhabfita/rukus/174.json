But when the light wind changes to a brisk gale** and waves rise in billows tossing them in every direction and they think they are enclosed by danger on all sides and they are bereaved of hope, they invoke Allah with an unconscious common feeling of an intuitive cognition and belief in Him, reasoning high exclusively of Providence to the end that if He delivers them from this catastrophe they would be indeed thankful"

The water is imbibed by soil which constitute the victuals of both man and animal causing the vegetal growths to flourish and grow healthy and vigorous. The earth is rendered beautiful and pleasing to the senses and the world comes to be adorned and furnished with all that is ornamental, the natural and the artificial, and when its inhabitants begin to think that it shall always minister to their necessities and pleasure and they are now the masters thereof, there comes Our command to pass by night or by day to convince mankind that it is not in mortals to command success, and we mow it down as if it never flourished the day before. Thus do We expound Our revelations and make Our discourse readily understood by people who reflect"
