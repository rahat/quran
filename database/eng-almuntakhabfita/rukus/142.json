As was expected, being wicked, they yielded to temptation"

Yet they chose to go by the world and its vanities, and unmerited forgiveness haunted their imagination; They said: \"We will be forgiven our iniquities\", and in vanity they wasted their days. Every opportunity favourable to a wicked end or purpose gave them occasion to a burst of merriment. Do they not recall to the mind that they did subscribe to the covenant Allah had revealed in AL-Tawrah which they have carefully studied; the covenant forbidding them to relate to Allah but the truth and emphasizing that the Hereafter is infinitely far better and more advantageous to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah.
