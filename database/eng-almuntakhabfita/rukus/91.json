They declare they have conformed to Islam when in fact their hearts entertain positive unbelief. Nor should you grieve over those of the Jews who are attentive hearers to falsehood which the demagogic rabbins had purposed that they know. Furthermore, they lend their ears to those among them who never had audience of you, who translocation the words of the Sacred Scriptures to alter the intended sense of Allah’s words, and they use their authority to instruct their listeners to accept only the Scriptural passages they discoursed them, and to reject and beware of all else. But the fact is that he whom Allah has justly intended to close his heart’s ears and his mind’s eyes; you shall not be able to provide him with an alternative of Allah’s decision. These and such persons are they whom Allah has declined to cleanse their hearts and minds from moral and spiritual defilement. They must expect disgrace and humiliation here below, and unremitting punishment hereafter"

If you decline, they shall not touch you and you shall be out of harm's way.
