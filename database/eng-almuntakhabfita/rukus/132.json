Therefore, dispense the measure and the weight equitably to the full and do not scant peoples' goods and chattels, chattels personal, chattels real nor chattels interest nor devalue what is valuable, nor create discord or make mischief on earth after it has been set in order\". \" This is best for you if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
