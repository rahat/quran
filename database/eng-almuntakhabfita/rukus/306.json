And He causes the clouds to heap upon each other like towers of mountains* -as clearly seen from an airoplane- Charged with hail or frozen raindrops, He makes them fall in showers to assail whom He will and drives them away from whom He will. The brightness of lightning emitted between the groups of clouds or between the clouds and the ground almost snatches away or blinds the sight"
