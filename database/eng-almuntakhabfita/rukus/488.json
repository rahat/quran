Evil indeed is the way they have conducted themselves in life"

Prompted by sense of quiet and by anxiety for their safety, they are vulnerable and susceptible to a physical force, they are susceptible to a loud cry be it uttered in approbation or denunciation. They are the avowed enemy; beware of them; Allah condemns them in as much as they are worth. How could they deviate from the path of righteousness to the path of vanity"
