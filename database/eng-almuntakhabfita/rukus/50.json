So when there comes a Messenger with a Book that corroborates and authoritatively validates the Authentic Books you hold in possession, you shall faithfully recognize him, uphold him and help him accomplish his mission. Now do you all subscribe to this allegiance and shall you pledge yourselves before Me to keep the vow!\" They said: \"We pray the prayer and vow the vow.\" \"Then,\" Allah said, \"you bear witness to this obligation which you shall relate to your people, and here do I subscribe to be also a witness to this course of action"
