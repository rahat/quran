It is incumbent on you to deny their tutelage. They mock your religion and amuse themselves with its principles. You just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"

Accordingly, Allah had decreed they be monkyfied and vested with swinish disposition and their monkey and swine-like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt and they be despised and rejected of men and be worshippers of idols. These and such persons have indeed assumed the worst position in society here and Hereafter and strayed far away from the path of righteousness"

Close-fisted be their hands and cursed they are for their evil thoughts expressed in words, but He is open-handed; He yields abundantly as He will and how He will. And the more Allah bestows on you O Muhammad of His bounty, the more do many of them err for infirmity of purpose, and display their transgressive infirmities of themselves and sink deeper in infidelity under the vexations of their minds. And We stirred up enmity and hatred among them -the Christians among themselves and between the Christians and the Jews till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they inflame passion for kindling a war against you Muhammad, Allah extinguishes their reason and their alacrity. They strive to spread mischief and create discord on earth, and Allah detests those characterized with prepensed malice"
