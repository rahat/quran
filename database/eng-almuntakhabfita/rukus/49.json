Say to them, O Muhammad \"grace rests in the hands of Allah. He confers it on whom He will and Allah is Wasi’un(Omnipresent) and 'Alimun"

This is by reason of their folly and want of sense that they interpret in words. \"We are not,\" they say, \"under any obligation to these illiterate faithless people -the Muslims-\" and they intentionally relate to Allah falsehood which they admit into their minds"
