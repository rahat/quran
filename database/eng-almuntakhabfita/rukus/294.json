Thus: those whom you invoke besides Allah, idols or human, shall not be able to create a fly even if they get together and combine their efforts. And if a fly should ravish anything out of their hands or out of their environ never shall they be able to reclaim it. How helpless is the suppliant - who is defeated by a fly- and the creature entreated -the fly"

He did not intend to put you in difficulty nor to create for you difficultness in the system of faith and worship He has chosen for you, the same system followed by your father Ibrahim . It is He -Allah- Who gave you people the descriptive and distinctive appellation \"Muslims \" in previous Scriptures as well as in this Book - the Quran - so that the Messenger Muhammad would be a witness of your actions and you come to be witnesses of peoples' actions which interpret their thoughts and characterize their rival systems. Therefore, engage in the act of worship, give alms and turn your minds to Allah and see that you be under His tutelage. He is your Tutelary Guardian ,and how ultimate in excellence is the Protector and the Ultimate of Ultimates to afford help"
