There and then said Talut to his troops: \"Allah has preordained that you be tested now for inclination, sincerity and endurance, therefore, he who drinks of the river to satisfy his thirst shall be discharged from my forces, but he who does not drink shall join my forces, but excused is he who takes only a few sips from the palm of one hand. Yet they all satisfied their thirst except for a few. And when Talut crossed the river with those who exercised unqualified obedience to commands, they wrere confronted by Jalut (Goliath) and his superior forces whom they feared. They said: \"On this day we are not a match for Jalut and his forces. But those who marched under the banner, believers touched by the divine hand, who believe they would be destined to be in Allah, the Creator’s, August Presence Hereafter, ventured to say: \"How often, Allah willing, has a small force submitted a superior force?\" Allah upholds the patient and persevering"

And We sent ‘Isa, son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, and We supported him giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit, Jibril. And had Allah willed, never would have their successors fought against each other, especially after receiving intellectual enlightenment and mental illumination. But they were at variance in a state of discord and enmity, some recognising Allah and obeying His statutes and others denying Him or rejecting His ordinances and decrees. And had Allah willed they would not have warred against each other, but Allah does and enacts what He will"
