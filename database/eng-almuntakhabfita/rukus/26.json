Therefore, he who takes upon himself to make Hajj, whether throughout the whole period or only at the end part of it, shall not engage in worldly matters until all religious devotional rites have been performed. No sexual congress, indecencies, nor wrangling are permitted during AL-Hajj, and whatever good deed you do shall come to Allah's knowledge. And fit out yourselves with what is necessary for the purpose, but the best provision indeed is piety, and revere Me, O you people of understanding"
