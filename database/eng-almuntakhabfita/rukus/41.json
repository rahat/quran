Similarly act the true believers who revere profoundly, they believe in Allah, His spiritual angels or attendants, His books and His Messengers. And they emphatically declare: \"We do not differentiate between one Prophet and another.\" And they beseech Allah for forgiveness with the following prayer of invocation: \"We have, O Allah, heard Your message with receptive hearts and venerated Your revelations and all enjoined, and we obey all Your statutes and ordinances You decreed. O Allah, our Creator, kindly grant Your mercy and forgiveness to us; You are the end of all destiny"

Therefore, beseech Him in heaven to take mercy on your souls, praying thus: \"O Allah, our Creator, do not condemn us if we fail to remember, if we err innocently, if our imperfections fall short of the purpose, if we dissatisfy Your standard or neglect a duty. And present us not, O Allah, our Creator, with difficulties as the difficulties you imposed on those who came before us in consequence of their arrogance and wrongful actions.\" \"And charge us not O Allah, our Creator, with the unbearable, pardon us, forgive us and have mercy on us; You are our Protective Guardian; help us gain advantage over those who deny you"
