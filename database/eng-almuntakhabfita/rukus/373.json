If you Muhammad could envisage the wrongful of actions when they stand before Allah for Judgement expressing reproaches against each other, You will hear those who were viewed with contempt saying to those whose pride consistently got the better of their prudence: \"Had it not been for you we would have conformed to Allah's system of daily and worship"

Deep in their hearts they will feel their guilt with pining regrets and vain repentances when they see the inescapable punishment. We will fetter and confine the infidels with chains around their necks. Would they be requited but with what is commensurate with their deeds"
