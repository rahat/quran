One of them saw himself pressing grapes to make wine and the other saw himself carrying bread on his head and the birds were eating therefrom. Impressed by Yusuf's appearance which they thought was conformable to reason and piety, they asked him: \"Can you reveal to us the significance of these dreams! We do see you a man of piety and we see in you virtue in its true signification"
