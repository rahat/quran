    "text": "Nonetheless, you infidels, worshippers of idols, may move freely in the land, if you will, and as, you please. You will be well secured against all assaults for a period of four months. But you must realize that you shall not defeat Allah's purpose nor can you escape His sure watch. He is Omnipresent with unlimited audition, Omniscient of all those whose purpose is to defy His cause, He shall disgrace them and put to shame"
