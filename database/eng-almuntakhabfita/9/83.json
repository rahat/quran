    "text": "And if Allah destines you Muhammad to return back safe and secure from battle and the occasion arises for another expedition and any group of these hypocrites ask your permission to join you, you simply refuse and say to them: \"Never shall you join me in any expedition nor shall you ever join me in combat or in any military campaign against an enemy. You rejoiced when you remained behind and stayed at home on the first occasion which was indeed crucial, and therefore, you shall again join those who remain behind"
