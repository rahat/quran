    "text": "Never set foot in it, nor perform an act of worship therein. A Mosque built on piety, obedience to Allah and the intention of serving Allah's purpose from the first day merits visiting for the purpose of worship; it is the most appropriate and the most worthy place for the purpose. Therein are people who aspire to physical purity and the purity of their souls and their minds. And Allah likes those who are physically, morally and spiritually pure"
