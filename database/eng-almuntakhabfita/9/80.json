    "text": "You may invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf O Muhammad or you may not; it is one and the same. Even if you invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf seventy times, never shall He forgive them. They denied Allah and His Messenger and insolently and defiantly disregarded Allah's commands; Allah does not guide the wicked to His path of righteousness"
