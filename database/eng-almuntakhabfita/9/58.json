    "text": "Among these hypocrites are some who question your integrity in the way you distribute the spoils and Zakat and try to defame you. They disregard Allah's fundamental motive and reason of action and tend to go by their selfish motive principle. If they go share and share alike, they approve their hearts to Allah, and if they do not have a good share in what is distributed, they express their disapprobation and moral condemnation"
