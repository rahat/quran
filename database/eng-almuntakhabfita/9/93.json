    "text": "But the consequence is indeed incurred on those who are rich and yet they make excuses to claim exemption and do not contribute to Allah's cause. Satisfied in mind, they are pleased to remain behind together with the stay-at- home. Allah has impressed their hearts with dullness of comprehension, and therefore, they do not apprehend the voice from Heaven nor can they be provoked to apprehend virtue. They do not know what is true and by consequence do not know what is good"
