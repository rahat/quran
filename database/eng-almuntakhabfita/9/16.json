    "text": "Did you think O Muslims that you would be left untested and untampered or be left in peace before Allah has yet to see: that you have distinguished yourselves on every front or line of battle, that you have been distinguished as the valiant and the patient who are unwearied in the face of difficulties and undisturbed by good or ill fortune and that you have ground for sustaining your tutelage under no one besides Allah, His Messenger and your co-religionists; Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do"
