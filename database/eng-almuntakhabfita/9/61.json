    "text": "Among these hypocrites are also those who prejudice the Prophet and label him: \"all ears\". \"He attentively listens to all that is being said, be it false or true; he is easily deceived\". Say to them: \"He bows down his ear and listens graciously to all that is of advantage to you\"; he believes those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and he is not deceived by those whom he perceives are lying\". \"He solemnly believes in Allah and trusts those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand for whom he is Allah's given mercy\". Indeed those who prejudice the Prophet shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned"
