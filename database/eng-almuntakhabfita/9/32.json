    "text": "With all the feeling in their minds directed toward falsifying the truth, they wish they could quench the very light of Allah by word of mouth, that is by propagating false rumours and uttering error against Him. But Allah is not moved by undue influence; He continues to make His way unrestrained to send His illumination -the Quran- proceeding from Him, until the souls have been lit by divine truth, and enlightenment has prevailed, albeit this be hateful to those who refuse to acknowledge the truth"
