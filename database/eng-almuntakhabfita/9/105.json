Then you shall be sent back to Him Who is 'Alimun of the invisible and of what your bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and of the visible and the seen and of what is avowed openly and openly disclosed. Then He shall inform you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do.\" [this is a reconstruction of the interpretation of this ayat]"
