Say to them O Muhammad: \"Do not offer defensive arguments; we will not believe you; Allah has informed us of your disposition and betrayed your attributes, and Allah and His Messenger shall watch over your innocence and follies, then you shall be sent back to Him Who is 'Alimun of the invisible and of what your bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and of the visible and the seen and of what is avowed openly and openly disclosed. There and then shall He inform you of what your minds and souls had impelled you to do"
