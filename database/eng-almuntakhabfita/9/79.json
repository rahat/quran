    "text": "To sink deeper under the vexations of their minds, they spoke maliciously of the rich who consider Zakat is but the vehicle of prayer and consequently give Zakat and do benevolence, and of those who are not rich who contribute their effort or a part of what they earn by labour. They bombarded them with foul epithets and laughed them to scorn. Allah has mocked them and betrayed their wicked attributes and destined them to a condign punishment"
