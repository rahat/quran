    "text": "One day shall these precious metals be melted by the heat of the Fire of Hell and their foreheads, their sides and their backs be branded therewith. There and then shall they be told: \"This is what you had treasured up and cherished; benevolence occasioned to you so much discontent that you denied the poor at their need. Now, you taste the torment which is laid on the damned in requital of hoarding up money and cheating the poor of their due and Allah of divine service"
