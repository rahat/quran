    "text": "They swear to you they never spoke slander against you, when in fact they uttered in a proud and unreserved manner the word emblematic of infidelity, and turned renegades. They meditated mischief featured in their plan to kill you on returning from battle* field, but their attempt upon your life utterly failed. And instead of impelling themselves to gratitude and gratefulness for your presence â€“in Madina which made Heaven endow them with prosperity, justice and suppression of selfishness; they attempted to avenge Allah's grace by returning evil for good. Nonetheless, if they return to their senses and in lowliest plight repentant stand, it will be to their advantage. But should they turn away and counsel deaf, Allah shall put thorn to the torment here and Hereafter, and no friend on earth nor a protector shall they find"
