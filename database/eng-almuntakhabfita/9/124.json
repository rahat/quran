    "text": "When a Surah is sent down, some of them -the hypocrites- insolently and mockingly say to each other: who among you has this Surah impressed his heart with religious and spiritual virtues? Indeed those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand are receptive to divine knowledge; it gives them moral support and confidence and increases their force of reason; their hearts become impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. Stirred by emotion, they rejoice beyond a common joy"
