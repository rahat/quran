    "text": "And the van of those who forsook their homes and emigrated with the Messenger, those who welcomed them and gave them aid and those who followed their example, are the recipients of Allah's blessings. Allah has been gracious to them. He is well pleased with them and they with Him. He has prepared for them gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and this is triumph supreme"
