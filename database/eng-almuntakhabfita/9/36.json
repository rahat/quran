    "text": "The calendar introduced by Allah when He created the universe -the heavens and the earth- determines the month as the space of time from one new moon to the next, corresponding to the period of one complete revolution of the moon in reference to a point, faxed or movable, and divides the year accordingly into twelve revolutions or months, four of which are sacred and exclusively appropriated to some special purpose emblematic of this right and commendable religion. Therefore, do not wrong yourselves during this period of time nor discredit yourselves by word or thought. And fight the idolaters in the whole as they fight you in the whole and do realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
