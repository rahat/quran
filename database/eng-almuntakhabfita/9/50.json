    "text": "When good fortune falls in your way, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated with envy and grieved at heart. But if you are befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy and express their thoughts in words, thus: \"With prudent foresight\" they say, \"we exercised caution beforehand to provide against misfortunes and turmoil\", and they turn their backs and go away well pleased"
