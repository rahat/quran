    "text": "Allah has accorded mercy to the Prophet and his troops who followed him and united in one body behind him at the hour of distress throughout the difficult days of the expedition* -scorching heat and inadequate supplies- when some of them lost heart through incipient weakness, and were about to lose field. Allah was merciful to them; He sustained them spiritually and upheld their pined bodies and minds after He has confirmed their true inclination and the truth of their firm disposition. He was gracious to them and indeed Rahimun. * Tabuk"
