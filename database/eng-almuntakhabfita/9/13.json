    "text": "These Pagans were they who almost always broke their vows and disregarded their treaties, they purposed to oust the Messenger from Macca and plotted to turn him out of Madina and they were the aggressors following the covenant into which both of you entered*. Therefore, would you not take these matters of fact as have been narrated to you and circumstance them after the right manner or do you fear them, when it is Allah whom you should fear if indeed you have conformed to His system of faith and worship"
