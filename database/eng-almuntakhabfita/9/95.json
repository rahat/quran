    "text": "They will swear to you with an appeal to Allah when you return to them from battle safe and secure that what they offered you as a reason for claiming exemption was justified; they mean to be exculpated so that you do not censure them or meddle with them with hostile intent. Avoid them O Muhammad and have nothing to do with them. They are morally impure, unhallowed and defiled by sin. Their abode shall be Hell in requital of what their minds and souls have impelled them to do"
