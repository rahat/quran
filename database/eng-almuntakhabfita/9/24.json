    "text": "Say O Muhammad to those who have conformed to Islam: \"If your fathers and your sons, your brothers and your wives your kindred and the wealth you have acquired, your trade which you fear may stagnate or decline and the comfortable and attractive homes, are regarded with more esteem and affection than Allah and His Messenger and than fighting the good fight of faith, then you just wait until Allah's fitting judgement presents itself. Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the wrongful of actions"
