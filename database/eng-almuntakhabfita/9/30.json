    "text": "The Jews distinguished Ezra -O Zair-* they called him the son of Allah and the Christians called the Messiah, son of Mary, the son of Allah; a fable resembling the falsehood fabled about Allah by those infidels who preceded them. Allah condemns them in as much as they are worth and afflicts them with such evils as indicate a malignant fate. How strongly deluded they are so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true"
