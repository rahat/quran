    "text": "Indeed, the only people qualified to attend the mosques of Allah are those who faithfully believe in Him and in Day of Judgment, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, who engage in the act of worship and give Zakat, for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer, and fear no one but Allah. Such persons are hopefully expected to be among those who have resolved to attain no other way but the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness"
