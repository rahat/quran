    "text": "They made it their aim before truth prevailed to sow thoughts of sedition and discord and the wicked plotted against the just. They deranged your ordinary pursuits of life O Muhammad as well as your divine course of action, hoping you would not prevail and firmly establish Allah's system of faith and worship.
