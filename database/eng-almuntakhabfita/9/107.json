    "text": "Those who built a Mosque professedly from religious motives when in fact it was built from selfish and evil motives: to be a vexation to the Muslims, to establish infidelity, to be a mere nest of the conspirators against Islam to cause dissent among the Muslims and set them at variance and to be an outpost for the warriors who fought against Allah and His Messenger before. They swear to you O Muhammad that they only mean good, but Allah knows well and bears witness that they are liars"
