    "text": "The simile of those who were given AL-Tawrah to carry in their hearts and in their thoughts and it did not reach their innermost being, nor did they absorb it In their minds or profit by it, speaks of a donkey carrying a load of books full of knowledge and learning but the donkey does not understand it nor does it Profit by it. Evil is the simile of a people who have refused to admit the truth of Allah's revelations and signs, and Allah does not impress piety on the hearts of the perverse who are wrongful of actions"
