    "text": "And when they see merchandise purposed for trade or they See amusement- the happiness of those that cannot think - they disperse and spread about and leave you standing addressing to them the divine discourse. Say to them: \"What Allah has of rewards and happiness in His heaven's realm is far better than the satisfaction and happiness you derive from trade and amusement in life. And Allah is the best Purveyor to fit every person with what is necessary and with what he needs"
