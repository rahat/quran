    "text": "And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you Muhammad some of those who mistake their way and do not employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions would have resolved to lead you in the wrong, when in fact they will only mislead themselves. Nor, even though they desire to harm you, can they get you into harm's way. Allah has revealed to you the Book -the Quran- to guide you and acquaint your heart with wisdom and He imparted to you the knowledge of what you at no time knew, and Allah's grace and blessings on you have been indeed abounding"
