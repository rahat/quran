    "text": "But those who believed in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety, shall Allah requite with what is commensurate with their deeds, and out of His bounty He shall complement their rewards with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety. Whereas those who turned indignant and displayed inordinate self-esteem, He shall requite with a condign punishment, and never shall they find besides Allah a tutelary guardian, nor can anyone afford them help"
