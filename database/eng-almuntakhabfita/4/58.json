    "text": "Allah commands you to characterize yourselves with habitual reverence, obedience and piety and to restore the property and whatever you hold in trust, be, it from Allah or from people, to those who have the rightful claim to it and or -to those who have invested you with the trust. And exercise justice when you sit in judgement upon people, and be consonant with the principles of moral right and in accordance with reason and fact. Allah enjoins only what is right and sound; how morally excellent is what He exhorts you to do; Allah has always been Samiâ€™un with (unlimited audition), and Bassirun, (He sees all that you do)"
