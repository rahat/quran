    "text": "And if a woman be apprehensive about her husband's ill treatment and she fears his aversion and cruelty or desertion, they incur no blame should they reconcile their quarrel and reconcile themselves with their own hearts and with Allah, for, the action of reconciling persons is consistent with piety. What prejudice the minds are greed or cupidity and non-admission of a point claimed in argument or of conceding anything asked or required. But if you turn your thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall find that Allah has always been Khabirun of all that you do"
