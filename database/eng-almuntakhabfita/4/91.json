    "text": "You shall also find others -hypocrites,- who wish to win your confidence as well as the confidence of their people - double face -; if victory sits on your helm, they apply their hearts to you, and if it sits on their people's helm, they apply their hearts to them and return to insurrection wherein they sink into vice under the vexations of their winds. Since, you have no binding agreement with their people, then unless they let you alone and proceed no further, offer you peace and curb their hostile appetite and withhold their wrongful hands, then beset them on all sides, kill them wherever you find them or whenever you gain mastery over them; Allah gives you, against them, a free hand and a complete liberty of action"
