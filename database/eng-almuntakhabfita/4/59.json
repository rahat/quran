    "text": "O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Obey Allah and be submissive to His will and obey the Messenger who is the only medium through whom Allah's guidance, command, ordinance and word are conveyed and expressed. And obey those among you who are invested with authority. Nonetheless, should you seem resolved to dispute any subject or a concern, then resort to Allah’s Book –the Quran– and betake yourselves to the Messenger for aid if in fact your hearts have been impressed with image of religious and spiritual virtues and you are strongly disposed to believe that the Last Day is comfortable to reality. This is a wise course of action ensuring safety and leading to the intended purpose"
