    "text": "And if you Muhammad happen to be with them -the Muslims- and it is time to observe a scheduled prayer, then you perform your act of worship as herein indicated: \"You lead the prayer with some of them (first group) who shall remain carrying their weapons while the others (second group) stand sentinel to keep guard ever you in the rear. When you have completed the first division-one time kneeling, twice prostrating then the first group withdraws to the rear to replace those in the second group who now join you during your second division at the end of which you Muhammad will have completed your two divisions Now there remains one division for each group to perform. The first group (armed) now performs the second division with the second group standing guard over them in the rear. Then both groups reverse their position until each group will have completed their two divisions being cautious at all times. The infidels wish you would neglect your arms and your equipment so that they attack you once for all. Yet you are absolved to lay down your arms if it rains or if you fall sick, but be constantly on your guard. Allah has prepared for the infidels a tormenting punishment humiliating indeed"
