Men have a rightful claim to be apportioned the proper share of what they have earned (by labour or inheritance), and women have a rightful claim to be apportioned the proper share of what they have earned (by labour or inheritance) therefore, do not express yearning in an emotional voice after the privileges of others, nor suggest it secretly to the mind, but long for the bounty of Providence and show that you have fulfilled the requirements for deserving what you prayed for; Allah is ever 'Alimun of all in all"
