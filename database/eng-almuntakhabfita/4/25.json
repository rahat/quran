    "text": "And those of you who do not have enough resources to marry the Muslim, -women who enjoy civil liberty, may turn the course and resort to the young unmarried Muslim women among those reduced to a servile state; and Allah Knows best those of you who justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will. You take them in marriage by permission of their guardians and pay them themselves, their dowers with good will, and choose those of them who are characterized with the attribute of chastity, faith and fidelity and ornamented with the flower of honesty and not enamoured of other men. And when once they are united in wedlock, they have to guard-themselves from being supposed (temptation). And should they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, then they shall suffer for their offence, but their punishment shall be half that inflicted on free women for the same offence. Such course of action is ordained for those who are afraid to live in celibacy lest they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and incur the undesirable consequence. And if you be patient and quietly await the course of events, it is better for you, and Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
