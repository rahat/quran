    "text": "Hope springs eternal in the human breast; the hope of some reward whether merited or unmerited, peculiar to man, is a desire with expectation not according with Allah's legislative and religious code. Therefore, it is neither according to your desires O Muslims nor is it according to the desires of Ahl AL-Kitab (Jews and Christians) that Allah proceeds. He who commits himself to an evil line of conduct shall be punished for it and suffer for his offence; he shall not find besides Allah a tutelary guardian nor can anyone afford him help"
