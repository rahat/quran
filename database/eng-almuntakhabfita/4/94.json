    "text": "O you who have conformed to Islam: When you journey into a foreign land in Allah's cause, you must distinguish by the sight and by other senses the disposition of the people whether or not they have conformed to Islam lest you spoil your best designs by faulty actuation. Nor should you say to anyone who greets you: \"You are not a Muslim;\" prompted by selfish motive principles of considering him a fit subject for plunder, in quest of the fleeting and evanescent glory of life below when glory, valuables, possessions and all graces abound in heaven's realm. Remember, if he is not a believer in Allah, thus were you before but Allah graced you with guidance to His path of righteousness. Therefore, discern the truth from what is false; Allah is ever 'Alimun of all that you do"
