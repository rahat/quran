    "text": "O you who conformed to Islam: Do not engage in the act of worship while you are under the influence of intoxicants nor pray when you are spiritually unconditioned, unless you are on the road, until you have bathed. And if you are sick or on the road or have defecated or touched women and the sensation or contact stirred you to passion, and you did not find water for ablution, then metaphoric ablution be a religious rite: apply clean sand, dust or dry earth lightly to your faces and hands; Allah is ever 'Afawun (Indulgent) and Ghafurun"
