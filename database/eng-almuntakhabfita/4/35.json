    "text": "And if you suspect a breaking of union or continuity between them or impending ruptured relations, then you may choose an arbitrator from his (husband's) side and an arbitrator from her (wife's) side, to whom both parties agree to refer their claims, in order to obtain an equitable decision. Should they both (man and wife) be willing to reconcile their differences and quarrels, then Allah shall reconcile them with their own hearts and make sympathy of love unite their thoughts; Allah has always been 'Alimun, and Khabirun (well acquainted with all that you are doing)"
