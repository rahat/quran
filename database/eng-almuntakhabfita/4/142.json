    "text": "The hypocrites represent to themselves in imagination that they deceive Allah, while He is 'Alimun of all their doings and only gives them enough rope to allow them free scope of action in order that they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct. When they stand to perform their act of worship they are dispirited and despondent; they perform their prayer only to attract notice and win the admiration of people, while in truth they hardly remember Allah"
