    "text": "And worship Allah and do not incorporate with Him other deities, and commit your parents to your kind care and display to them and to the kindred who are related by blood and to the orphans a friendly and kind disposition. A similar disposition is extended to the poor and to the neighbour related or immediate, to the associate and to the wayfarer, and to those on-hand, whether they be captives or reduced to servile state. And do realize that Allah detests every boastful who exalts himself unduly and displays inordinate self-esteem"
