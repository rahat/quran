    "text": "But exempt from aforesaid prescriptive right are those of them -the hypocrites- who take refuge with or are related to a people with whom you are bound by a covenant relating to peace, truce, alliance or the like or -those of them- who are perplexed by reason of their kinship to your opponents; they do not have the heart to fight on your side against their people nor to side with their people-against you. Had Allah willed, He, would have instigated them against you, and then they would have waged war against you. Therefore, if they are disposed to let you alone, proceed no further and offer you peace, then leave them alone; Allah does not commit you to any line of action against them"
