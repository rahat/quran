    "text": "O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not eat your property out of each other in irreverence, wickedness, dishonesty and impiety (usury, gambling, cheating, adulteration, treachery, monopoly, bribery, embezzlement, stealing and such vices); this leads to a gradual self- destruction, unless it be a trade or exchange of commodities for a profit consented to by both the buyer and the seller. Nor shall you kill each other or commit self-murder; Allah is ever Rahimun to you"
