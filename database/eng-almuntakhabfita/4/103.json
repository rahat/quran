    "text": "When you have completed your prayer, you keep remembering Allah and bearing Him in mind standing, sitting and lying on your sides. Evoking reminiscence of Allah inspires to the hearts and minds a state, of composure. However, when you feel safe and secure, you then perform the act of worship in the proper manner as prescribed by Allah, for the act of worship has been a prescriptive rule incumbent on those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand to observe at the scheduled hours"
