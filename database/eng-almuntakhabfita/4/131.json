    "text": "And to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and that is on earth, and We have enjoined those who were given the Book before you -Ahl AL-Kitab- as well as you Muslims to entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. And if you should deny Allah and refuse to acknowledge His infinite Authority, then you must realize that to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all, that is on earth, and Allah has always been Ghaniyun (Independent), (Absolute), and Hamidun (Worthy of all praise); His grace abounds in the universe"
