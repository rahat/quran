    "text": "And if you journey into a foreign land, be it in the cause of Allah or for any other purpose, you incur no guilt if you should shorten your prayer (one time kneeling, twice prostrating performed twice instead of three or four times), that is if you fear you might be exposed to a willfully inflicted injury by those who are an open enemy of the faith. Therefore, be cautious; the infidels are indeed your avowed enemy"
