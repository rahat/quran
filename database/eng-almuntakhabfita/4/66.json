    "text": "And had Allah enjoined them to sacrifice their lives in His cause or to go out of their homes to fight against positive unbelief, they would not have obeyed the injunction with the exception of a few. Had they obeyed Allah's authoritative admonition, it would have been much better for them here and Hereafter. Such obedience would have confirmed their peace and position of authority and deep joy would have settled on their spirits"
