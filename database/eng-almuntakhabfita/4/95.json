    "text": "They are not alike, the stay-at-home for no valid reason (sickness, trouble and the like) and those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has invested those who strove with their wealth and their lives in His cause with special distinctions a step higher in the scale of dignity and rank than that He invested in the stay-at-home. Yet both did Allah promise efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given. But those who strive shall Allah distinguish from the stay-at-home by quite a rich reward"
