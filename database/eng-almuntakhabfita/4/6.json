    "text": "And test the orphans now and then until they reach maturity and be fit -for marriage. If you feel they are characterized by good sense and prudence, then hand over to them their property and you must not abuse it nor act with expedition of time and events to absorb it or devour it before they come of age. And he who is entrusted with the property must not impose a liability or charge a fee for the execution of his functions, but be virtuous should he be wealthy and opulent. But if he is poor, then he may remunerate himself with equity. And when you hand over the, property to them -the orphans- you must have others witness the transfer, and sufficient is Allah to be Hasibun (a Witness Who calls to account)"
