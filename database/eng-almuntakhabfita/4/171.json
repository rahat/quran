    "text": "O you Ahl AL-Kitab, Do not carry your religious beliefs to excess and beyond the truth, nor should you relate to Allah but the truth, Isa, the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah, is simply His Word and edict He authoritatively proclaimed to Maryam and a spirit that proceeded from Him and was conveyed to Maryam by the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel). Therefore, you had better believe in Allah and acknowledge His Messengers and stop saying \"Allah in Trinity;\" this is only to your benefit. Allah is only and absolutely One, glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes; far be He beyond comprehension; His omnipotence precludes begetting a son , when all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belong to Him. And enough is Allah to be your Tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you"
