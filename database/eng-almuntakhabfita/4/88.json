    "text": "How can you -Muslims- get to be divided in thought and in feeling, some in favour of and some against the hypocrites and you class injustice with wisdom and virtue, when Allah has already grouped them together under the. class â€“ Infidels- for their common attributes and their qualities and actions which have earned Allah's hatred! Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has declined to guide to His path of righteousness! He whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness shall no one be able to guide thereto"
