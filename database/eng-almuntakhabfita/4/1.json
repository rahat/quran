    "text": "O you people: revere Allah your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Who brought you -into being from one single soul-Adam- and from him did He create his mate -Eve-, and from joining both in matrimony did He propagate multitudes of men and women. And revere Allah Whom you invoke for aid and protection and to Whom you appeal in witness that a statement or the like is true, and revere the wombs. That bore you and regard them as having a divine and sacred character; Allah has always been Raqibun (Omnipresent), He has always kept a vigilant eye upon you"
