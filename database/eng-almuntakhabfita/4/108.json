    "text": "They hide their evil deeds to conceal them from the notice of others, but how can they conceal them from the notice of Allah when He is Omnipresent. Their reasoning when they are alone. at night admits a discourse to their dishonesty and to their disposition against the principles of Allah. But Allah's Omnipresence besets them on all sides and it follows that He has always been Cognizant of all that they do"
