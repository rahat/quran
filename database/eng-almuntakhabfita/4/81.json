    "text": "They -whose faith is greatly shaken- show obedience in your presence O Muhammad and say to you: \"We obey all that you exhort us to do.\" But when they depart from where you are, some of them design by night a scheme of action not in accord with your principles, and Allah puts in writing all that they propose to do. Therefore, disregard them and rely upon Allah, and enough is He to be your Tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you"
