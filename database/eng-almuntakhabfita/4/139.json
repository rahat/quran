    "text": "Those of you who take the infidels who deny Allah as intimate friends and favour their tutelage to that of their co-religionists who are of the same law, had better pause to think. Do they seek honour and power at their hands and pride themselves in so doing! But all power, omnipotence and honour rest on the helm of Allah's hands"
