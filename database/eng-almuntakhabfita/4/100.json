    "text": "And he who emigrates in the cause of Allah (because of persecution, oppression or the like) shall find a good many places of refuge and abounding resources. and he who quits his homeland with the motive principle of serving Allah's purpose and subserving His Messenger shall win Allah's grace. And if it happens that he comes upon the encounter with death on the way, before he has reached his destination he shall be graced just the same; his reward has thus early been incumbent on Allah"
