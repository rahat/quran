    "text": "It was they who said to the people: \"Wherefore do you spend money on those accompanied by Allah's Messenger -who emigrated with him to Madina- and spend yourselves in their cause?\" \"Put a stop,\" they said, \"and refrain from spending on them until they have forsaken him and quitted Madina\". But to Allah, be it known, belongs the rightful possession of treasuries of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do nod comprehend this as a fact"
