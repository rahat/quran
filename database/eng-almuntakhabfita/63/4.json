    "text": "If you see them you admire their physical or material frames, their looks speak affection and their discourse speaks their presence, and when they speak they speak all cream, skimmed, and they speak sense that you cannot help but open to them your heart's ears, while in effect their words are flattering and hollow, devoid of belief, just as hollow stems of trees are devoid of life. Prompted by sense of quiet and by anxiety for their safety, they are vulnerable and susceptible to a physical force, they are susceptible to a loud cry be it uttered in approbation or denunciation. They are the avowed enemy; beware of them; Allah condemns them in as much as they are worth. How could they deviate from the path of righteousness to the path of vanity"
