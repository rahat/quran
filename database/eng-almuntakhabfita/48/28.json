    "text": "It is He who has sent His Messenger to transmit the spirit of truth to guide people into all truth, and to proclaim by public discourse the Quran featuring the appropriate system of Faith and worship conforming with truth and agreeing with reality. A Quran serving as the criterion and the canon wherein Providence is the guide; it aligns and makes unanimous the course of action, of thought and of life of all concerned, Muslims and Non Muslims whose religious practices are contingent upon man - made related aspects of the one religion whose unclouded and authoritative front is Islam; and good enough for you people is this testimony on the part of Allah"
