    "text": "These Meccans are they who have persistently denied Allah and stood in your way to obstruct your course to the Sacrosanct Mosque and the offering to where it be scarified; Had it not been for treading injuriously, unawares, upon the faithful believers -men and women-residing among these Meccans, which believers you did not know nor could you recognize, and the error of injuring them would be a crime, We would have allowed you to make a march for Macca; Allah extends His mercy to whom He will. Had they- the unknown believers- been dissimilar in appearance We would have afflicted the infidels among them -the Meccans- with a condign punishment"
