    "text": "Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are unrelenting in combat with those who deny Allah but thoughtful of each other, loving and affectionate among themselves. You see them kneeling in supplication and prostrating in adoration in quest of Allah's efficacious grace and making His good will their aim. Their countenances bear evidence of prostrating their reason to Divine Revelation and their looks are bright, beaming with hope. This is the product of a sequence of events portrayed as such in the graphic appearance described thus early in AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and AL-Injil (the Bible). It is a picture standing similitude exact of a seed which began to spring, putting forth its stalk which grew stronger and stronger. It supported leaves, flowers and fruits, displaying a spectacular and imposing situation distressing those who deny Allah and throwing them into mental disorder and discomposure. To those of them, whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds of wisdom and piety, has Allah promised a gracious reward"
