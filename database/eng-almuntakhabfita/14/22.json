    "text": "When the die is cast then AL-Shaytan (Satan) shall say to those whose hopes were doomed to disappointment: \"Allah had promised you the truth affording expectation of all that is good showing signs of future excellence\". \"I also promised you and afforded you ground of expectation of all that would seem good and allure you to brighter worlds. But as was expected I broke my promise\". \"I had no authority over you; I simply presented you with false inducements attracting your attention and influencing your appetites and I led the way\". \"Therefore do not blame me but you should lay the blame upon yourselves. I cannot help you now nor can you help me either from the torment laid upon the damned. Indeed, I renounced your idea of incorporating me with Allah as a predominant partner aforetime; the wrongful of actions are destined to eternal suffering"
