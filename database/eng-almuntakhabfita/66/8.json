    "text": "O you Whose hearts: reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: \"In your lowliest plight stand repentant, and feel contrition for all the wrong you have done and view it with dissatisfaction and be sure you will never execute it or the like of it ever again. Perhaps Allah will relent and quit you all His debt and welcome you into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow\". \"This is the day Allah shall exclude the Prophet and his companions, who faithfully and steadfastly believed, from infamy, humiliation and disgrace. Their faces glow with light emanating from Allah's countenance and proceeding ahead of them to illuminate the way for them when they contemplate the most difficult and inevitable crossing. Carrying their books bearing their records in their right hands, they pray: \"Our Creator complement our light and forgive us; You are Qadirun (Omnipotent over all things)"
