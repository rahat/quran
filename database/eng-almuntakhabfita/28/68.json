    "text": "And Allah, your Creator, creates what He will and chooses what He will and whom He will whereas they -the infidels- and people at large cannot impose on Allah their choice in any matter irrespective of its nature and consequently they have no choice. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely beyond all they incorporate with Him"
