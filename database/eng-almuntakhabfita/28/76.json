    "text": "Qarun was a Hebrew of the people of Mussa (possibly a cousin), one who exercised iniquity and injustice toward his people. We made all grace abound in him. We bestowed on him such immense treasures that the keys (of the chambers where the treasures were hidden) would have been an immense burden for a host of strong men to carry (were a burden for three hundred mules). His people said to him: \"Do not rejoice boastingly, for Allah does not like those who boast` vaingloriously of what they are made to possess"
