    "text": "We have sent down to you revelations featuring the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and conducting you from want of spiritual and intellectual sight into enlightenment and illumination. We quoted to you instances of punishment and We discoursed parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set fourth and We referred to the fate of some of those who existed before you, all serving as a deterrent and a warning for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah"
