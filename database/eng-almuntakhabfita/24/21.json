    "text": "O you who conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: Do not follow the footsteps of AL-Shaytan (Satan) nor walk in the footsteps of those with characteristics befitting him. And he who follows the footsteps of AL-Shaytan must realize that he incites people and commands their sympathy to commit themselves to immorality and to all that is wrongful and obscene. And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you, He would never have vindicated any of you, but He does vindicate whom He will and Allah is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun"
