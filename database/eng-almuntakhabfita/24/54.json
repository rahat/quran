    "text": "Say to them O Muhammad: \"Obey Allah and obey His Messenger and comply with their commands.\" And should you people turn your backs and close your heart's ears then you must realize that the Messenger's responsibility is simply the fulfillment of his duties and you â€“people- are responsible for the burden of wrongs you bear. Therefore, if you obey him, he is the spirit of truth that shall guide you into all truth, and he is only responsible for relating the divine message and the elucidation of its text"
