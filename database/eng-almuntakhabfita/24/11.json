    "text": "Indeed, those who have invented the lie -to defame the virtuous woman- are a group of people among you. Do not consider the incident a misfortune that has befallen you, on the contrary, it is to your advantage that it came out to light instead of being whispered about with bated breath. Every one of those involved in discrediting the faith shall be requited with what is commensurate with his share in the falsified incident. As to him whose spirit has moved him to lead the imprudent move* he shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned"
