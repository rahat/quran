    "text": "O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not address the Messenger in the same manner you address one another nor mention his name without annexing to it an attribute irrespective of whether he is present or absent. Allah is fully aware of those of you who slip away quietly from the assemblies screening themselves behind others. Those who transgress the Messenger's command or willfully neglect it had better know that he who disobeys the Messenger disobeys Allah and by consequence may Allah close their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes or He may wed them to a calamity here and punish them severely Hereafter"
