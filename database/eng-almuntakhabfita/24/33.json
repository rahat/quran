    "text": "And those who cannot marry because they lack the means may conform their life and conduct with the principles of morality until Allah makes His grace abound in them. And those on hand who wish to buy their freedom by performing certain paid-services deserve attention. You reduce a mutually binding agreement to writing if you believe that they qualify -stamped with virtues and sound minds- and give them -in benevolence and/or alms- something of the grace of Allah abounding in you. And do not force your female slaves -or any of your females- into prostitution for a worldly gain -a Pagan custom- nor make them recover their liberty by prostituting their honour if they seek chastity and purity. And he who forces them into sin shall suffer for it, whereas they -the women- shall, under the circumstances be recipients of Allah's Mercy and Forgiveness, for Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
