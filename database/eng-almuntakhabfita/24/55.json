    "text": "Allah has promised those who have conformed to His system of faith and worship and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety a reward, \"I shall depute them on earth\", He declares \"and delegate them to keep the scale and commission them with power to maintain the right\", I shall set them in the appropriate social scale just as I deputed those before them in whose hearts reigned piety\". \"And I will confirm for them the religion I have chosen for them as the appropriate system of faith and worship\". \"I will also exchange the fear and the dread which fell upon them for peace of mind and soul provided they adore Me with appropriate acts and rites and do not incorporate with Me other deities\" And he who henceforth denies, the divine origin of faith -Islam- or this system of faith and worship shall he and such persons be the faithless perverse who are morally depraved"
