    "text": "Indeed, the faithful are those who have conformed to Islam and recognized Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and acknowledged His Messenger. And when they are in council with him on a matter of common interest they do not break off individually or in toto until they have been excused. Those of them who ask your permission O Muhammad under the circumstances are indeed true and sincere in their recognition of Allah and His Messenger. Therefore, should they ask your permission to leave for a valid reason, then you may excuse whom you will and invoke on their behalf Allah's forgiveness; Allah is indeed is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
