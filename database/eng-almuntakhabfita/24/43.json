    "text": "Do you not see that Allah directs the course of the clouds as they form and by the air in motion make them join together in one body, then He condenses them into a dense mass wherefore you see rain drops issue from their midst. And He causes the clouds to heap upon each other like towers of mountains* -as clearly seen from an airoplane- Charged with hail or frozen raindrops, He makes them fall in showers to assail whom He will and drives them away from whom He will. The brightness of lightning emitted between the groups of clouds or between the clouds and the ground almost snatches away or blinds the sight"
