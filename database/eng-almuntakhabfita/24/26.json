    "text": "Wicked women accord with wicked men and similarly, wicked men accord with wicked women. They both accord in one and their principles and practice accord well together, whereas women in whose hearts reigns piety accord well with men of piety, and men who are careful of the duties owed to Allah accord well with women of piety, their principles and practice accord well together. These are innocent of all that the wicked traduce in propagation and these are the blessed with the grace of Allah and with blessed provisions"
