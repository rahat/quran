    "text": "Do you not see that all created beings animate and inanimate, in the heavens and on earth submit to Allah and celebrate His praises and extoll His glorious attributes (whether through the bodily structures. or through thoughts expressed in words), and so do the birds upon the wing extending their wings. Each group knows its mode of prayer and its mode of expressing admiration to Allah and extolling his glorious attributes, and Allah is 'Alimun of all that they do"
