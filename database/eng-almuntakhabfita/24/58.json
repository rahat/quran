    "text": "O you who have conformed to Islam: Those on hand serving, you and the children who have not reached the age of discretion must ask your permission before entering your rooms when you are improperly dressed: before dawn prayer, when undressed for the afternoon rest -siesta-, and following your last night prayer (when you are reedy to go to sleep); three prescribed periods of privacy. Other than these particular periods you are absolved and so are they to move freely and to come round -in an informal way- attending to each other. Thus does Allah distinctly express to you people His revelations guiding you to the proper way of life relative to moral conduct. Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun"
