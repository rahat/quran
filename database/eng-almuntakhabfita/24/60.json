    "text": "And those of the women who are past reproductive life ( post menopausal) who have lost hope of matrimonial union are absolved to take oft their outer vestment provided they do not show or display any fictitious additions or adventitious ornaments which draw forth men's interest or cause them to come to them by influencing their appetites. However, if they conform their life and conduct to the principles of morality and use their outer garment, it is much better for them and may guard them against temptation and from being supposed. And Allah is Sami'un and 'Alimun"
