He is 'Alimun of your innermost being and of your disposition and your condition, and in Day of Judgement when all are sent back to assemble before Him for Judgement shall He inform them of all that they had done as recorded in their books and attested by their limbs and their senses; Allah is 'Alimun of the whole and of all in all"
