You regard them with tenderness when they have denied Allah and denied the truth you have received. They drove the Messenger along with you out of their midst, and ousted you of your privileges, for no reason other than the war of disbelief against belief in Allah, your Creator. If indeed you have gone to war to strive in My cause and to serve and satisfy My purpose, then how could you make a friendly intimacy with My enemies and regard them with tenderness! I know well what your breasts store of thoughts and feelings and what your breasts forge, I know what you converse secretly and utter below your breath, and what you suggest secretly to the mind. I also know what you avow openly and openly disclose, and what you utter loudly, and all that is being said. Therefore, he, who amongst you attempts to do this, will have wronged himself and wandered from the path of righteousness.\". .. Seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore\".

They said to their people: \"we are certainly innocent of your ills and of your false gods you worship besides Allah\". \"We refuse to recognize you or submit to you, and enmity and hatred between us shall forever prevail until you have abandoned idolatry and submitted to the authority of Allah and until you have sincerely believed in Him alone with works imprinted with wisdom and piety\". Therefore do not confuse the issue and fail to distinguish between invoking Allah's forgiveness on behalf of your dead, and the supplication made by Ibrahim on behalf of his father. Ibrahim had promised his father, earlier, he would invoke on his behalf Allah's forgiveness albeit he could not guarantee the outcome. But when he realized that his father remained a faithful adherent to Paganism, he at once rejected him and declared his innocence of his fatherhood. And when Ibrahim and his followers resolved to quit their people and their homeland they prayed: \"Our Creator, in You we trust, and we repent the disagreeable time we spent with our people, and we repent what we might have done or left undone, and You are the end and the purpose for which we are destined"
