    "text": "(And let it be clearly understood) that: No man or a woman whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues be in a position to exercise choice when once Allah and his Messenger have decided on a course of action, pronounced a Judgement or brought a cause to a decision. And he who disobeys Allah and His Messenger will have deviated from sense and will have cast himself head-long in the maze of error"
