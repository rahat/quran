    "text": "You incur no blame should you defer the turn of whom you will and bring over to your side whom you will and whom you choose of those whose turn you have deferred. This will make them happy and their eyes will speak content and they will not grieve at heart, they will all be satisfied with what you have accorded them and Allah knows what is in your hearts and in your minds. Allah has always been 'Alimun and Halimun (Forbearing toward His creatures)"
