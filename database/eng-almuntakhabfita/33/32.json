    "text": "O you the wives of the Prophet: You must realize that you are not like any of the other women in privileges, dignity, state and all other aspects. If indeed you do entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah then you must not be disposed in your discourse, to accommodate yourselves to the rest nor care to please so that you guard yourselves from being supposed by the one whose heart reflects the morbidity inherent in his innermost being. Show discernment in the guidance of your discourse* and let it reflect equity and justice"
