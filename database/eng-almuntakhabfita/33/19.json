    "text": "They are liberal in promises, stingy in performance, in offering help and in financial aid. When fear and dread overwhelm you see them look at you with a countenance speaking a different language; their eyes roll and turn round in their sockets like someone about to faint or on whom death is casting its shadow. Yet no sooner dread be dispelled than they call you everything they can lay their tongues to and give you a lick with the rough sides of their tongues, being stingy in benefaction and benediction. Such persons did not really conform to Allah's system of faith and worship and by consequence did He destine them to be losers whose hopes are doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness, and nothing is easier for Allah to do"
