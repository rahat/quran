    "text": "O you the Prophet: We have ratified and confirmed by sanction and solemn enactment your wives whom you have dowered as well as those on hand -the prisoners of war- whom Allah has made assignable to you. Also lawful to you are the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who emigrated with you in addition to any woman of the same law who dedicates herself to the Prophet and the Prophet wishes to be bound to her in wedlock. This is a privilege that is granted to you exclusively and not to the Muslims at large. We know what We have promulgated and legislated for them concerning their wives and those on hand so that you do not feel that you stand at the mark of criticism and Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun"
