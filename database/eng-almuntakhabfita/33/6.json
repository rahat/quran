    "text": "The Prophet is more closely attached to those who conformed to Islam than they are to themselves and his wives are their mothers. Those of you who are related by blood or by descent from a common ancestor take precedence of those who conformed to Islam and of those who emigrated in inheriting each other as is decreed in Allah's Book unless it be a favour you are doing to those who are unrelated or an edict that has been set forth by Allah in writing and be this so in the Quran"
