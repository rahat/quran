    "text": "Your wives O Muhammad incur no blame nor do they stand at the mark of criticism for discoursing and appearing before their fathers or before their sons, before their brothers or their brothers' sons, before their sisters' sons or before their women or before those who serve them of those they have on hand. As for you O wives of the Prophet: you actuate yourselves with the mixed feeling of dread and reverence toward Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and bear in mind that He is ever a witness to all things"
