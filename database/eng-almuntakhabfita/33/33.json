    "text": "And stay at home and if you have to go out for a necessity do not expose the physical parts affording keen pleasure to the senses nor be clothed with what beautifies, nor display your charm, a picture that was habitually seen in former times of ignorance and paganism. And observe the act of worship and give Zaket (alms). for alms are but the vehicles of prayer and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends to protect you from enormity and its consequences and keep it away from you the Prophetic household and to rid you of and to cleanse you from moral and spiritual defilement"
