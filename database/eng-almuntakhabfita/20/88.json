    "text": "And he fashioned it -the melted gold- in the shape of a calf's body -like the bull of Osiris in the city of Memphis, Egypt- which mowed like cattle when down wind. No sooner did they see a golden Calf emitting a sound than they forgot Allah Who delivered them and gave themselves up to the calf as the object of worship saying to each other: \"This is your Ilah, the Ilah of Mussa whom he forgot, and by consequence he missed his way"
