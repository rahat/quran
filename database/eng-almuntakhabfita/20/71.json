    "text": "Have you conformed your will\" said Pharaoh, \"to the will of the Ilah of Mussa before I permit you to do so! Indeed it is your chief who taught you magic has misled you\". Therefore, you just wait. I will amputate your hands and feet on opposite sides and I will have you all crucified on the trunks of palm - trees, and you shall come to know which of us, can inflict punishment to a greater degree, agonizing, and more lasting to make you live in Hell on earth"
