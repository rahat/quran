In fact, for each of you people Jews, Christians and Muslims have We authoritatively determined a law and a course to follow, and had Allah willed, He would have made all of you one conjoint body united in feeling and thought. But He meant to test your qualities with what He has ordained for-you. Therefore, contend you people for good will and for deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety; you are all destined to go back to Allah, and there and then shall He inform you of the detailed particulars of all the points upon which the whole unreasoning turned"
