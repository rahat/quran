And when the overwhelming effect of terror is eased off and the hearts calm down, the infidels shall ask: What was it that Allah said! They shall be told: \"The Truth.\" And He is AL-'Aliyo (the Unique whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality, the Unique Who is eminently entitled to the designation \"the Supreme\") and AL-Kabir (the Omniscient)"
