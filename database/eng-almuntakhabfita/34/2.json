And He has Omniscience of all that comes down from the realm of heaven and from the vault of its floor and of all that ascends of deeds and of the souls of those who have done the deeds. He is also 'Alimun (Omniscient) of the spiritual and the animate and of all that is inanimate and He is AL-Rahim (the Merciful) and AL-Ghafur (the forgiving)"
