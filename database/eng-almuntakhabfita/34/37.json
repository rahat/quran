    "text": "(You people had better realize that) neither your wealth nor your progeny are the conditions vouchsafing for your nearness to Allah nor do they sanction your misdeeds or your infidelity. To the contrary, what bring closer to Allah are conforming one's will to His will and imprinting one's deeds with wisdom and piety. Such persons shall be requited with double the reward commensurate with their deeds and shall live safe and secure in stately abodes"
