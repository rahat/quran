And if I should follow the path of righteousness leading into the truth, it is only because Providence is my guide. He inspires me with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth; He is Sami'un (His audition is unlimited) and Qaribun. His Omnipresence puts Him in the proximity of all His created beings"
