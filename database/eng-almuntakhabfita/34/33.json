    "text": "And there shall the passively-minded say to those who exercised inordinate self-esteem: \"but you took cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom and you made its breastplate work day and night and you kept pressing hard upon us for adopting polytheism and you urged us to deny Allah as the only Ilah and to incorporate with Him other deities\". Deep in their hearts they will feel their guilt with pining regrets and vain repentances when they see the inescapable punishment. We will fetter and confine the infidels with chains around their necks. Would they be requited but with what is commensurate with their deeds"
