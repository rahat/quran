    "text": "They -the Jinn- were assigned to work for him and do as they were told and produce, build and construct for him what he willed of sanctuaries and places of worship in the form of curved structures of firm material; some bearing weight and others merely ornamental. Also to make for him images and statue and all kinds of pots and vessels of rounded form, broad and deep serving various purposes, some being large enough to be reservoirs and others as fixed huge copper vessels. And We said: \"Work righteousness O you the sons of Dawud and let your deeds reflect gratitude and gratefulness to Me\". But it is only a few of My servants who do this and impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness"
