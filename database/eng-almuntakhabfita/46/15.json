    "text": "We commended to man his parents, to commit them to his kind care and display to them a friendly and a kind disposition. With travail did his mother bear him and with travail did she bring him forth, and between bearing him, weaning and rearing him she spends thirty months of bodily and mental toil. Then when he has grown to maturity and attained the age of forty he invokes Allah, thus: \" O Allah, my Creator \" he prays, \" create in me a clean heart and actuate me with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness to You for the efficacious grace you conferred on me and on my parents: that I do deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety, that You create in my progeny clean hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues, Now I do repent of the wrong doings I might have done, and I join those who commit their causes to You"
