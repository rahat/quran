    "text": "We had endowed them with power and ability, with diligence and capacities of action, with wealth and knowledge, with mental receiving Dower and talent, and with many qualities which total up to a much higher degree then those that are summed up in you' people. We conferred on them the power of hearing and seeing, faculties divine, and We conferred on them the seat of feeling, understanding and thought, and the seat of consciousness, intellect and volitions, but they' took a bad advantage of thesc divine qualities and misused them, Consequently neither their power of hearing nor that of seeing were of any advantage to them nor did they derive benefit of their intellect or of their volitions; They simply ignored Allah's revelations and signs, and by consequence they were beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they mocked at, owing to their inordinate self-esteem"
