    "text": "One day those who denied Allah shall be exposed to Hell fire and be told: \" You abused the gifts Allah has endowed you in life: faculty, Power, quality, ability, talent - and countless other good things, and you exhausted them all in sensuous enjoyment which was your chief object of life, and you neglected to spare what will insure your future security Hereafter. Therefore, this Day you will be subjected to the affliction of humiliation in requital of turning your heads in contempt, your inordinate self-esteem and of your evil practice"
