    "text": "Therefore, in patience O Muhammad possess you your soul as did the resolute among the Messengers; and do not dwell on their punishment to be hastened on; for, on the day they face resolutely what they have been promised, they will realize that life here was a scene of ephemeral glory, imperceptibly minute as though it had lasted for no more than an hour of the time of daylight. This is a divinely inspired message entrusted to a Messenger; a message that warns of a condign punishment, and who shall suffer it but a people given to wickedness and crime"
