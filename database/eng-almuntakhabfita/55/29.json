    "text": "All created beings, the spiritual, the animate and the inanimate in the heavens and on earth address to Him a humble prayer for mercy and blessings individually or in litanies, pray to Him with supplication in difficulty and in difficulties, or pray to Him for deliverance from what is burdensome, or beg Him for relief, aid, and assistance in adversity and in time of danger, or ask of Him forgiveness for iniquities, or to exalt the pious and debase the despot and oppressor. Each and every day countless and different prayers and petitions, some being a repetition, and others being born anew, are addressed to Him for different requests each according to his or her circumstances and needs"
