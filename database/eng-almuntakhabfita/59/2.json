    "text": "It is He Who drove those who denied Him among Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book) out of their homes at the beginning of the thronging for the battle. You yourselves, O Muslims, did not think they would go out of their fortresses nor did they themselves think that their fortresses were penetrable to any hostile action, not to mention that contemptible notion of being proof against Allah. But Allah reduced them to impotence in His own manner which they never expected and He inspired terror in their hearts so that as they had tried to ruin the whole tower of Faith, they perfected their own ruin. They demolished their own homes and reduced their own property into a useless from by their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed you people of sight and can lift to Allah their inward sight"
