    "text": "He is Allah, the only llah there is, Alimun (the Omniscient) of the invisible, the hidden and the unseen, and of what the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and of what the bosoms forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what you converse secretly and utter below your breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed, and with what is uttered loudly and with all that is being said, AL-Rahman, and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)"
