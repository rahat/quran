    "text": "Therefore, all that Allah has bestowed on His Messenger of the resources gained from the villages' inhabitants under such circumstances belongs to Allah and to the Messenger, to the kindred and the orphans, and to the indigent and the wayfarer who, due to lack of means, travels on foot. This is to prevent such gains from passing into the hands of the wealthy among you. And whatever the Messenger commands you to do, you must do, and whatever he forbids you to do, you do not do,and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He punishes severely"
