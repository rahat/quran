    "text": "They will not fight you in all, except in fortified villages strengthened against attack, or from behind walls in a position of defense when they are besieged. They are badly disposed to enmity at each other. You think they are unity personified while in effect their hearts are totally diversified. This is on account of their lack of sound judgement in the choice of means and ends"
