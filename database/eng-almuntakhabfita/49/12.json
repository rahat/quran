    "text": "O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety. Avoid suspicion in many instances and the conjecture of the existence of something evil or wrong without proof; suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin. Nor play the spy upon each other or peer inquisitively and impertinently into the nature of other peoples' actions, nor traduce or slander one another by speaking evil or falsehood or speaking maliciously behind his or her back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother! Indeed you would shrink from it with horror. Therefore, keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah is indeed Tawabun (Relenting) and Rahimun (Merciful). Allah indicates to people that He weighs them not by their parentage, lineage, descent or rank in life, but by the image their hearts reflect"
