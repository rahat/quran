    "text": "O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety: Men must not laugh at other men with the intention of producing a specified deriding, or ridiculing, or contemptuous effect upon one another. It may be that the laughees are better than the laughers in many aspects. Nor should women laugh at other women with the intention of producing a specified deriding or ridiculing, or contemptuous effect upon one another. It may be that the laughees are better than the laughers in many aspects. Moreover do not defame one another nor nickname each other by insulting or repulsive derogatory names. How bad it is to be called malicious or wicked after having professed the Faith with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety! And he who does not change his mind with regard to past conduct, then such persons are guilty of wrongful actions. \"The man that dares traduce because he can, with safety to himself, is not a man \" \"Cowper\" Suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin"
