    "text": "(The desert Arabs say to the Messenger); \"We are strongly disposed to believe in Allah and obey His ordinances.\" Say to them O Muhammad: \"You have not yet been absorbed in the Faith, but you may say; \"We have conformed to Islam\". But not yet have your hearts been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. If you obey Allah and the voice and reason of His Messenger, Allah will not depreciate the reward of your good deeds; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
