    "text": "O you people; We created you from the union of a twain, male and female, and We divided you into nations and communities and dispersed you over the earth to get to know each other and not to boast your descent or rank. The one among you whom Allah values most and is held precious in His esteem is he who keeps Allah in mind and acquaints his heart with wisdom, and regards Allah with breast filled with reverential awe. Allah is Alimun, and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things). A tribe named Banu Asad went to Madinab, where the Messenger had emigrated, seeking relief for their families by reason whereof a famine had ensued that year. They had conformed to Islam, but they thought at that stage that they had become absorbed in the Faith, which they were not. Consequently, Allah defines to them and to the people at large the stages they go through"
