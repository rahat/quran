    "text": "Those who avoid major sins and do not commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, but occasionally fall into mistakes, faults or errors may find Allah Ghafrun (Forgiving),and Rahimun (Merciful); He knows well your nature, your character, and condition of mind besides your disposition and your temperament; for it is He Who brought you into being from the earth, then He embedded you in your mothers' wombs; therefore justify not yourselves before him; He knows best those whose hearts are impressed with the image of virtues and whose deeds with wisdom and piety"
