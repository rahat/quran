    "text": "And for once, said Isa, son of Maryam : \"O Bani Isreal (Children of Isreal);\" \"I am the Messenger of Allah who has been sent to you to corroborate your faith in AL-Tawrah which is set before me and to confirm what it foretold of whose turn he is to come. And here I come to comfort your hearts and announce to you the joyful tidings of whose turn he is next to come, a Messenger named Ahmad\". But when he -Ahmad- came confirming what Isa foretold and presented them and the Pagans with clear Divine evidence serving as a ground for belief, they said: \"This is only sorcery assumed by him -by Muhammad"
