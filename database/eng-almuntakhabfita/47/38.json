    "text": "There, at that point, you people are invited to spend, all that you can afford in the cause of Allah. Some of you will show unwillingness, and he who is parsimonious and unwilling, will only deny himself the future security depending on how much he had advanced in life to be credited to his own account in heaven's realm. And remember that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (Independent and Absolute); He is the riches of the heavens and the earth and if you are as dependent on Him as indeed you are, then you are poor enough and if you people turn a deaf ear, He will replace you by other people who will not be the like"
