    "text": "And keep in mind that life here is but an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought, and an amusement which brings happiness to those who cannot think. But if your hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and you entertain the profound reverend dutiful to Allah, He will pay you all you merit and He will not ask you to spend your wealth in His cause except to give zakat (alms); for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer and if he -the needy- be hungry, it is zakat that feeds him"
