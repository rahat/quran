    "text": "And does it compare: the garden of bliss and surpassing beauty promised to those who believe with breasts filled with reverential awe wherein rivers flow with untainted pure fresh water, and rivers flowing with tasteful, unchanging, immutable milk, rivers flowing with wine making glad the hearts of those who drink it, and rivers flowing with strained clear honey, a garden in which grow all kinds of fruits and the grace of Allah's mercy and forgiveness. Does this blissful state compare with the state wherein one suffers the permanent abode in Hell where in the inmates are forced to drink boiling water melting their bowels"
