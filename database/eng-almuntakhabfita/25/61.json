    "text": "Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes Who installed in the heavens a belt of the celestial sphere divided into twelve equal Parts - signs of the Zodiac*- through one of which the sun passes each month (the belt extends 8 or 9 degrees on both sides of the ecliptic within which the apparent motions of the sun, moon and principle planets take place). He installed therein a lamp, the sun glowing for illumination and a moon earth's satellite dispersing light to dispel the darkness of the night"
