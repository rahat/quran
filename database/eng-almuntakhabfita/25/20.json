    "text": "We never sent Messengers before you O Muhammad but were human who ate food and could not survive without alimentation and they moved about from place to place on foot. We also tested the people by exposing opposites -contrary in nature, character, tendency, status, wealth- to each other and those with thoughts of sedition in one toward another. Therefore, will you people -who have conformed to Islam- be persistent, constant and unwearied in the face of difficulties and hindrances and exercise patience! Your Creator is Bassirun (Omnipresent Whose constant vigilance has always been extended to all His creatures)"
