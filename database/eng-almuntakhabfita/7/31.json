    "text": "O you children of Adam: Pay attention to your personal appearance and your apparel at every mosque where you dutifully observe your act of worship. The apparel often proclaims the man and his due respect for the dignity of the occasion, not to mention the solemnity of applying your minds to the presence of Allah. Do not be influenced by the Pagan's superstitions of permitting certain kinds of food and prohibiting others, but eat and drink of the permitted but avoid intemperance; Allah does not like the extravagant who carry anything to excess"
