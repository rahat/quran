    "text": "O you Children of Adam: Let not AL-Shaytan lead you astray nor tempt you to do what is wrong as he had allured your aboriginal parents by the use of cunning and deceitful attractions inducing them to lose their modesty and decency and expose their private parts and there, he attained the desired end and the goal to his will, besides prompting their expulsion from Paradise. He sees you, and so do his associates, whereas you do not perceive them by sight. We made the satanic take interest in those who deny Allah"
