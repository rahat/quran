    "text": "The infidels insolently call upon you O Muhammad for information relative to the point of time at which the predetermined Eventful Hour of Judgment takes place! Say to them: \" it is only Allah alone Who knows when, He alone has the rightful claim to the knowledge of the how and when of here and Hereafter; no one reveals it when due but Him as His word prompts\". \"It weighs quite heavily on the heavens and all those within and on the earth and the hopes of all those therein, and the encounter with it is simply a sudden start of a surprise\". They ask you about it as if you are anxious to know the how and when and as a result you have been informed. Say to them: \" Rest assured that it is only Allah alone Who does know when, but most people do not realize this fact"
