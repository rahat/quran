    "text": "There, did Mussa choose from the innocent among his people seventy persons, in compliance with Allah's command to present themselves at the divine assignation. When they gathered at the arranged time and place, fearful echoes thundered in their ears and the earth's surface convulsed under their feet as an expression of strong divine reproach against those among them who committed themselves to the most evil conduct. There and then did Mussa pray, thus: \"O Allah, my Creator: had You willed you would have planted their Hereafter and mine before now\". \"Would you destroy us in requital of the evil committed by the simpleton among us!\". \" It is Your means of trial, You use it to subject people to the test and consequently deafen the hearts' ears of whom You will and open the minds' eyes of whom You will, You are our Tutelary Protector\". \"We beseech you to forgive us and to have mercy on us; You are the Most Merciful of all who forgive"
