He is the Principle Power by Whom events are unalterably predetermined\". \"If I indulged in prophecy and were able to foretell future events and realize the unseen I would have made all grace abound in me, and never would I have failed to be out of harm's way\". \"I am only a spectacle and a warning to people whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand"
