    "text": "Say to them O Muhammad: O you people: you had better believe that I have been sent to you all with a divine message from Allah Who has the rightful claim to the heavens and the earth. Allah Who has the supreme controlling power and the absolute authority over them; there is no Ilah but Him Who gives life and occasions death. Therefore, you people had better believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and accept with consenting mind His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet who solemnly believes in Allah and His divine words -those inspired to him and to other Messengers before him-. You had better give credence; to his statement and discourse on practical divinity and follow him so that you may hopefully be guided to the path of righteousness"
