    "text": "He is it Who brought you into being from one single soul -Adam- and from him, by a special creation, did He evolve his mate in whom he seeks consolation and finds comfort. And when he -the early man- approached her with amorous intention, she conceived and the pregnancy passed unnoticed in its early stages. But as the ovum became an embryo and the embryo developed into a foetus which grew larger and the mother grew heavier, the parents invoked the deity's mercy and blessings interpreting their thoughts in words \"If You \", they said, \"give us a healthy child free from abnormalities and malformations, we will most certainly be grateful"
