    "text": "I will\", said Allah, \"deafen the hearts' ears of those whose pride gets the better of their prudence, who exhibit unjustifiable inordinate self-esteem in the world they live on\". Whenever they see a sign clearly indicating Allah's Authority, they take pride in setting it to nought, and when they see the path of righteousness, they simply avoid it, but when they see the path of wickedness, they joyfully follow it, this turn of mind accords well with their persistent denial of Our signs they have been oblivious of"
