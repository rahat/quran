    "text": "Do you people consider it exceptional to a degree that excites astonishment that Allah sends to you illumination and enlightenment at the hands of a man from your midst in the capacity of a spectacle and a warning to guide you into all truth! \" \"You had better recall to mind his favours and impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude for the efficacious grace He conferred on you; He made you the inheritors of the people of Nuh and imparted to you a wealth of knowledge, and privileged you with a distinguished stature more than He graced other nations\". Therefore, remember with gratitude and humility the privileges He bestowed on you so that Heaven may prosper you"
