Grieved at heart, he said: \"Evil indeed is what your minds and souls have you to do; did you wish Allah's punishment be hastened on! He dropped the plates and dragged his brother by the head, laying the blame on him, But Harun said to him: \" O son of my mother; the people judged me wanting in power and authority over them and almost killed me\". \"Therefore, do not let my enemies gloat over me and rejoice at my misfortune, nor should you associate me with the wrongful of actions"
