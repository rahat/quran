    "text": "Who is more wrong than he who viscously and wrongfully relates to Allah falsehood or denies His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority! Such persons do have what has been apportioned to them in life according to their good or bad books, just as they do have access to the share of the Book imparted to them by Our Messengers. And when Our angels of death disembody their souls at the predetermined point of time, they ask them: \"where now are those you incorporated with Allah and invoked besides Him!\". They have forsaken and renounced us \" they say, and failed our expectation \" So; they were witnesses of their own actions and of their deeds reflecting infidelity and disobedience to Allah"
