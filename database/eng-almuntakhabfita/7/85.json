    "text": "And to the people of Madyan (Midian), We sent their brother Shu'aib, who said to them: \"O my people worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; you have no Ilah but Him. There has come to you a sign from Allah, your Creator, evincing both the truth of my mission and Allah's supremacy. Therefore, dispense the measure and the weight equitably to the full and do not scant peoples' goods and chattels, chattels personal, chattels real nor chattels interest nor devalue what is valuable, nor create discord or make mischief on earth after it has been set in order\". \" This is best for you if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
