These and such persons whose deeds were imprinted with wisdom and piety in life below shall reap the fruits of their piety. Allah bestows on them His prevenient and efficacious grace here and His efficacious grace is far better for them Hereafter, and how excellent and supreme is the heavenly abode of the God-fearing"
