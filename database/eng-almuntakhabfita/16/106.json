    "text": "He who renounces his faith in Allah after he has conformed his will earlier to His will shall suffer for it unless he has been forced to do so by persecution and assault but deep down he preserves a heart happily maintaining the image of religious and spiritual virtues. But he who cunningly and deceptively incites someone to reject the idea of Faith and allures him or her to brighter worlds shall have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and these are they who shall pass through nature to eternal suffering"
