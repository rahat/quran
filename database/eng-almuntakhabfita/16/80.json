    "text": "And it is Allah Who made of your homes a place inspiring calm and peace of mind, and of the skins of animals or hides He provided you with portable dwellings -tents- easy to carry in your travels from place to place and to pitch them where you choose to rest. And from their wool, their fur and their hair did He furnish you with movable articles, goods and chattels to enjoy up to a predetermined point of time"
