    "text": "If these infidels who deny the Hereafter were to be likened in a parable to anything material or immaterial to represent their attributes, their image shall always stand similitude exact of evil, whereas if we were to represent Allah in a parable we find Him above all comparison and like unto Him there is none. And if His attributes were represented in a parable they shall be summed up in the word \"Perfection\" personified. and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)"
