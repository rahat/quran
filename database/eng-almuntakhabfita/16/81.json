    "text": "And it is Allah Who made the trees and other objects He created cast shadows* when they intercept light to protect you from the scorching heat of the sun and He hollowed out for you caves in the hills and the mountains to shelter you and He equipped you with garments to protect you from the heat and other garments -armours- to shield you from the weapons when you contend in warfare. Thus does Allah mean to make all grace abound in you that you may hopefully conform to Islam"
