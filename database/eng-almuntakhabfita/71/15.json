    "text": "Nuh added, \"do you not see how Allah created seven heavens one above the other and how infinite is the expanse and immense are the constellations. How distant one constellation is from the other and unique in orientation, how an inert moon or any planetary body varies appearance according to the extent of her illumination, how the sun and the moon are made to subserve life and time computation. How the lower heaven has been embellished with countless glittering colossal fiery bodies featuring ornamentation, yet those whom He permits to penetrate deep into heaven find it veiled with darkness as if there were no stars featuring decoration"
