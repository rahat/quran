    "text": "To Him is attributed the authority and control over the known and the unknown and the mysterious schemes and systems which hold and structure together, in harmonic relations, all that exists in the heavens and on earth. He gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He Will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will; He is indeed AL- Alim (the Omniscient) of all things"
