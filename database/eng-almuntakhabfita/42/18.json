    "text": "It -the predetermined Hour- is the wish of those who deny Allah and challenge the truth of it and that it be hastened on, but it is not the object of desire of those whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand, who dread it and stand in awe of it. They know well it is the truth and they make no doubt of its reality. Indeed those who contend with opposing argument against the predetermined Hour, denying that it shall come to pass, are transgressors who are lost in the very depth of the maze of error"
