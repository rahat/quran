    "text": "Thus did We inspire to you O Muhammad the Quran through the spirit Jibril (Gabriel) who actuated you by Our command. You neither knew what the Book the Quran was nor what Faith was like. But We made it -the Quran- a source of light wherewith We impart knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light to guide into all truth whom We will of Our servants. You (Mohammed) do indeed guide to the path of righteousness"
