    "text": "There and then shall you see the wrongful of actions alarmed at their sinful iniquities in life being exacted with the sudden fear and the apprehension of danger which has beset them on all sides; whereas those who had believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety, rejoicing beyond a common joy in the beatitude of heaven's realm where they shall find any object of desire or anything of any kind that their emotions are directed to its attainment be in readiness to come to them at will. This is indeed the great bounty and munificence of Providence"
