    "text": "And you shall see them exposed thereto -the Fire- and back they recoil with abhorrence from it, mortified with fear and humiliation, glancing with stealthy eyes and catching a glimpse of it. And there shall say those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: \"losers indeed are those who lost themselves in vanity, and their crimes lost them mercy and lost them their families on the Day of Resurrection.
