    "text": "Never did Allah take, adopt or beget a son nor did He share His sovereignty with any god; for, if He did, then each Allah would have had a kingdom of his own independent of the others and each would have established his own laws and made sure to exalt himself above the others. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all that they falsely attribute to Him"
