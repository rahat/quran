    "text": "Tossed with their unballasted wits in fathomless and unquiet deeps of controversies, Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book) were divided in opinion relative to the number of the young men, and in the course of time, some will say: \"They numbered three and their dog the fourth\". Others will say: \"Five, their dog the sixth\", an exercise of divination, whereas others will say: \"Seven, their dog the eighth\". Say to them O Muhammad: \"Allah, my Creator, knows best their number; it is only a few who have been given the knowledge of the number and the significance of the even\". Therefore, do not involve yourself O Muhammad in the heat of their dispute but treat the subject from an objective standpoint only so as to exhibit the actual facts and never seek counsel from any of them upon the event"
