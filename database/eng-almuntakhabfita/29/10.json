    "text": "Among people there is he who declares his belief in Allah. Yet when he is harmed in His cause he at once nurses despair and equalizes suffering here in magnitude and degree with the retributive punishment inflicted by Allah Hereafter. And should you Muslims be fortunate to be crowned with victory from Allah he proclaims he was in your array and a part of your troops. Does Allah not know what peoples' bosoms store of thoughts and feeling"
