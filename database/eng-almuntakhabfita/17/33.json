    "text": "Nor should you deprive anyone of life Allah has made sacred, unless be justified for a proved crime. And if someone has been killed wrongfully, then his next of kin is authorized by Allah to use the means of procuring redress of grievances through avenging his right or forgiveness, (court of law, now). But should he choose to avenge his right, he must not carry it to excess, for the divine law is on his side"
