    "text": "He whom Allah guides to His path of righteousness is the one who is guided by the spirit of truth into all truth. But those whom Allah sends astray, never shall you find for them tutelary guardians besides Him. We shall throng them drawn on their faces In Day of Judgement, blind, deaf and dumb to be delivered to their appropriate quarters in Hell which is constantly fed with fuel .As often as it abates We feed it so that they suffer the increasingly fierce and merciless flames of the fire"
