    "text": "Nor should you encroach upon the property of the orphan, unless it be with the motive principle of improving, advancing or raising it to be a better quality or condition, until he reaches maturity and be able to take charge of it. Fulfill the solemn promise if you should make one and keep the vow and meet your engagements and obligations. A vow is great responsibility and those who break it shall have much to answer for in Day of Judgement"
