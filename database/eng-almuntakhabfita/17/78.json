    "text": "You just engage in the act of worship and hold intimate mental and spiritual intercourse with Allah at the point of time of the sun's declination or deviation from the Meridian or the zenith of the sky as it begins to sink toward setting and onward to the time when the darkness of the night prevails* And noteworthy is the Quran when recited at dawn. Indeed recital of the Quran at dawn is of great moment and a goodly loan. It inspires piety to the heart and makes the soul sensible of the presence of Allah; it is attended by the angels who witness its perusal"
