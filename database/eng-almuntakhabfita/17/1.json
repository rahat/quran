    "text": "Glory be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes attendant upon His manifestation of conducting His servant by night from the Sacrosanct Mosques - Macca- to the Farthest Mosque,- Jerusalem whose precincts We had blessed. A journey that was planned without the factor of time or that of space to show him our spiritual world and some of Our signs evincing both Our Almightiness and Omnipresence. Allah is indeed AL-Sami' (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition and AL-Bassir (He clearly sees all things)"
