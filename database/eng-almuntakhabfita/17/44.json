    "text": "The seven heavens and the earth and all animate and inanimate beings therein praise His glory and extoll His glorious attributes. There is not one single creature but displays outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace reflecting Allah's Omnipotence and Exclusive Authority, but you -infidels- do not apprehend their way of ascribing His glory. Indeed, He has always been Halimun (Forbearing) and Ghafurun (Forgiving)"
