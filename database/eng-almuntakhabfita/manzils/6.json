It may be that the laughees are better than the laughers in many aspects. Moreover do not defame one another nor nickname each other by insulting or repulsive derogatory names. How bad it is to be called malicious or wicked after having professed the Faith with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety! And he who does not change his mind with regard to past conduct, then such persons are guilty of wrongful actions. \"The man that dares traduce because he can, with safety to himself, is not a man \" \"Cowper\" Suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin"

Avoid suspicion in many instances and the conjecture of the existence of something evil or wrong without proof; suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin. Nor play the spy upon each other or peer inquisitively and impertinently into the nature of other peoples' actions, nor traduce or slander one another by speaking evil or falsehood or speaking maliciously behind his or her back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother! Indeed you would shrink from it with horror. Therefore, keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah is indeed Tawabun (Relenting) and Rahimun (Merciful). Allah indicates to people that He weighs them not by their parentage, lineage, descent or rank in life, but by the image their hearts reflect"

Allah is Alimun, and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things). A tribe named Banu Asad went to Madinab, where the Messenger had emigrated, seeking relief for their families by reason whereof a famine had ensued that year. They had conformed to Islam, but they thought at that stage that they had become absorbed in the Faith, which they were not. Consequently, Allah defines to them and to the people at large the stages they go through"
