    "text": "Mankind was a single â€˜Ummah (Nation) of common descent occupying a definite territory. By natural generation, numbers multiplied and were scattered in various directions and became disunited emotionally and mentally. There and then Allah sent Prophets as a spectacle and warning to all. He equipped them with the Book of Truth guiding into all truth in order to judge between people regarding issues of reason. Yet those who disputed its precepts were the same who were given the Book (Ahl Al-Kitab) imparting enough signs guiding them into illumination and mental enlightenment. But they were no longer disposed to the truth due to their mutual enmity and malignant intention. Nonetheless, Allah will guide the truth-seeking believers to His path. Allah guides whom He will to the path of righteousness"
