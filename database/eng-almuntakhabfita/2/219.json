    "text": "They ask you, O Muhammad, about intoxicants and gambling. Say to them: \"They both involve a major sin as well as some advantages, but their evil outweighs their advantages.\" And they ask you how to spend in benevolence! Say to them: \"Spend in benevolence and benefaction of what you can spare in excess of your actual requirements.\" Thus, Allah elucidates to you people His revelations and ordinances that you may hopefully consider the consequences"
