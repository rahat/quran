    "text": "When you have divorced women and they have fulfilled their determined period of waiting for three months and both of you are willing to reconcile, then you either reclaim them in equity and honour or free them in equity and honour. Do not reclaim them for a selfish end or spite them and he who acts in this manner will wrong himself. And do not mock Allah’s revelations and statutes, and render solemn acknowledgement of Allah’s divine favour conferred upon you and revere the Book He sent down to you and the knowledge and wisdom He imparted to you to caution you to commendable conduct, and revere Allah, and realise that Allah is 'Alimun of all"
