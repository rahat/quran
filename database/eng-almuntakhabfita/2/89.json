    "text": "When a Book was presented to them from Heaven, a Book , a treasure purposed to this life and life beyond, corroborating AL-Tawrah, they refused to accept it although it clearly foretold the Prophet Muhammad's coming; an event they had always been expecting and at times wishing it be hastened on to help them get the upper hand in argument and gain advantages in arguments and victories in wars over those who deny Allah. Yet when the prophesy was fulfilled and the Prophet Muhammad came with the Quran, they refused to acknowledge the truth of his mission. Consequently, Allah has consigned those who deny Him to misery and their homes shall be cursed"
