    "text": "They call upon you, O Muhammad, to inform them about the new moons. Say to them: \"It is one aspect of the varying appearances of the moon according to the extent of its luminosity indicating the point and passage of time in which the sequence of events take place in the material universe, and for estimating the point of time when AL-Hajj to Allahâ€™s Sacred House is performed.\" You people must realize that it is not in conformity with conduct to the divine and moral law nor with righteous living that you irrationally enter the houses from the back doors, this is an irreligious notion*. It confers with divine and moral law to enter the houses from the front doors. And see that you lift to Allah your inward sight so that heaven may prosper you"
