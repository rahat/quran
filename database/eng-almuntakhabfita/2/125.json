    "text": "We ordained the Sacred House -the Ka’ba- a safe retreat for people, that you Muslims take Ibrahim’s station where he performed the prescribed acts of devotion, as a place of prayer. And We committed Ibrahim and Isma‘il to cleanse My House from moral and spiritual defilement and to impart real sacredness upon it and ceremonially purify it for those who revolve in it in procession ,for those who retreat for religious observance, for those who kneel in supplication, prostrating mentally and willfully acknowledging Allah's Omnipotence, perfection and Authority, and those who prostrate their reason to divine revelation"
