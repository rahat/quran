    "text": "Ramadan is the month of fasting during which the Quranâ€™s poignant disclosure was revealed to guide people into all truth; its clear revelations guide out of darkness and superstition and eliminate want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, and its precepts are the standard to judge right or wrong. Therefore, he who grasps sight of the birth of the moon shall begin to fast. But he who is sick or proceeding on a journey shall fast the same number of days at a later time. Allah purposes to put you at ease and not make you experience discomfort. He wants you to complete the course of fasting so that you praise Allah and extol His glorious attributes for His guidance to the path of righteousness and that you may hopefully impel yourselves to feel gratitude"
