    "text": "And Recall when you camped at the foot of Mount and heaven thundered and the awe inspiring echoes thundered in your ears as We entered with you into a Covenant and We stabilized the mountain above you when it shook with such fits for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and We said: \"Adhere to all that We have imparted to you in AL-Tawrah and observe and esteem the code of discipline and regulations, hold to your promise, pay attention and regard\". And your people said: \"We have opened our hearts' ears \" But their actions did not accord to their words. They impiously took the calf and drank with delight, to tame their wicked feelings. Say to them, O Muhammad: \"If these are the principles of your faith steering your course of action, then how worthless is your apprehension of divine truth and system of religious belief, if you truly represent yourselves as people of faith"
