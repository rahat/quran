    "text": "Those of you who feel death approaching shall bequeath to their wives the means of sustenance for a period of one year, and in case of sudden death the heir is charged with the same responsibility. In either case, the widow shall remain in his residence for the same period of one year. But should the widows choose to change their residence voluntarily after fulfilling the determined period of four months and ten days, then you incur no consequence for what they do with themselves as long as they are equitably and honourably disposed; Allah is Azizun and Hakimun"
