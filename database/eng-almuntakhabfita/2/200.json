    "text": "And when you have concluded your religious devotions and rites of AL- hajj, then praise Allah and extol His glorious attributes as you customarily praised your forefathers in pagan times, but Allah’s praises and glorious attributes should be extolled from one’s heart and innermost being. Nonetheless, among people are those whose thoughts are set upon the mundane of this world; they invoke Allah to bestow upon them life’s comforts to satisfy their enjoyment and content, and consequently never shall such persons have a share in the Hereafter"
