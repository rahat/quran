    "text": "It is not your responsibility, Muhammad, to guide the strayed to the path of righteousness but it is Allah Who touches the hearts of whom He will with His divine hand opening their mindsâ€™ eyes to His path of righteousness. And whatever you spend in divine service reflects piety in your deeds and it is but an advantage to you, that is if what you spend is truly intended to fulfil your obligation to Allah and to satisfy your conscience and hearts. And whatever you spend in benevolence shall be reimbursed in your favour and you shall not be wronged"
