    "text": "Many of Ahl al-Kitab wish they could turn you renegades, a desire induced by base envy reflecting sincere hatred for you people who have conformed to Islam, even though they have recognized the truth. Nevertheless, forgive them and do not entertain them with antagonistic thoughts until Allah circumstances matters of fact in His own manner and His command comes to pass. Allah is indeed Qadirun over all in all"
