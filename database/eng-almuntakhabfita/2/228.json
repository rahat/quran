    "text": "Divorced women shall remain for three months, or menstrual cycles, in order to regard their condition. They are not absolved to hide Allahâ€™s creation in their wombs if they are true believers. There and then their husbands shall have prior entitlement to reclaiming them and resuming marital life if both agree to reconciliation. And women have as many rights as equal obligations, and men are a step higher than they are in the scope of responsibility, and Allah is Azizun and Hakimun"
