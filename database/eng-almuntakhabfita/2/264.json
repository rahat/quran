    "text": "O you whose hearts truly believe: Do not cancel the divine reward you merit for your benevolence by the reminders of your generosity or inducing mental anguish. You are then like he who spends his wealth ostentatiously under the guise of benevolence only to attract attention and win peopleâ€™s admiration while truthfully, he believes neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. His similitude is that of a rock covered with dust and fertile soil which has been exposed to torrential rain stripping it of its soil leaving it completely bare. Such persons have lost; unable to reclaim anything they had falsely earned. And Allah does not guide those who deny Him to His path of righteousness"
