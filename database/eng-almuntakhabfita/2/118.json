    "text": "And those who are so ignorant to know the truth vented their hearts, which are overflowing with the sense of sin, they said: “If only Allah would speak to us or display a sign evincing both Muhammad's Prophethood and integrity!” This much said those who preceded them who had similar natured hearts as those who succeeded them. Their thoughts are so base, pursuing vanity. We have expounded Our revelations and signs evincing both Omnipotence and Authority to people who lift to Allah their inward sight"
