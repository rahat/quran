    "text": "You, Bani Isra‘il, know that We gave Mussa AL-Tawrah and We sent other Prophets sequentially: We sent ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, and We supported him by giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit. Yet is it not indeed incredible that as often as a Prophet is sent to you with divine principles not to your taste, you become extravagant in your account of yourselves and display inordinate self-confidence? Some you renounce and some you accuse of assuming false character, and others you kill or you conspire their death"
