    "text": "Indeed, those who conceal the knowledge of the clear signs and revelations guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and from want of spiritual and intellectual vision into mental illumination and enlightenment have come within the measure of Allah's wrath. They have earned the curse of Allah and of the angels and of the pious whose curse damages the accused; their own homes shall be cursed"
