    "text": "Again that once when you said to Mussa: \"we cannot bear to eat always the same kind of food nor can we put up with it, and so beseech Allah, your Creator, on our behalf to make the soil produce for us what it vegetates of its verdure and of its cucumber, its garlic and lentils and of its onions. \"Displeased as he was, Mussa said: \"Will you people exchange the worthy and wholesome food for the food of the lower quality! \" \"If this be your wish, then leave Sinai and go down to a town and you will come to have what you asked for\". There and then were they stamped with humiliation and misery and came within the measure of Allah's wrath. This was in the train of their denial of Allah's revelations and signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority and of bringing death unjustifiably upon the Prophets of their own nation. Such vices were a sequel to the disobedience natural to them that it drew after it their addiction to transgression"
