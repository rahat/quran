    "text": "Do not consider the martyrs in Allah’s cause to be dead. They carried truth’s banners against odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of martyrdom through resisting shedding blood with spiritual armour. Do not say, \"They are dead\", for they are alive in heaven's realm but your senses do not perceive this fact"
