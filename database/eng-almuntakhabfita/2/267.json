    "text": "O you whose hearts have been touched by the divine hand, spend of the lawful and virtuous things you have earned and of the earthâ€™s fruits We produced for you, and do not select corrupt returns for devotion to Allah and dispose of it benevolently if you yourselves would reluctantly accept it and would shut your eyes to it if unable to help. And Allah is Independent, Ghaniyun; His grace abounds in the universe, Worthy of all Praise"
