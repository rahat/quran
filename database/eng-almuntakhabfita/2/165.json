    "text": "Yet among people are those who equal with Allah deities haunting their imagination and regard them with the same affection and devotion dutiful only to Allah. But those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand maintain Allah in the inmost affection of their hearts and reverence Him with true and affectionate devotion and consider Him the principle of their existence, the heart of their purpose and their Ultimate end. And if only the wrongful of actions could visualize the torture awaiting them, they would realize that to Allah belongs all power, and that Omnipotence is asserted as His own; He punishes severely"
