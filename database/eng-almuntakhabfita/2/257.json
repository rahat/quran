    "text": "Allah is the Guardian of those whose hearts truly believe spiritually. He guides them out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, whereas those who denied Allah are guided by the prince of darkness, or by those with Satanic characteristics, leading them out of light and driving them into darkness and want of spiritual and intellectual vision. Such persons shall be the inmates of Hell fire, their eternal abode"
