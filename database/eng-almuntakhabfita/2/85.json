    "text": "Yet again you ignore the principles you supported and you kill each other and expel some of your own people from their homes and you ally yourselves with their enemies in sin and transgression against the divine law and moral principles. When some of them fall into captivity you revert to the principles in AL-Tawrah and redeem them, albeit the same principles forbid you to shed your own blood nor to expel each other from your homes. Do you people credit part of the Book upon the ground of Allahâ€™s Authority and discredit part upon the ground of your authority? Indeed, he who adopts this line of conduct shall suffer for his offence; he shall be lost to shame here. Such persons shall be delivered to the abyss with its torrential scorching and roaring flames Hereafter; they shall suffer torment and be put to torture; and Allah is not unaware of what you do"
