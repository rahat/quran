    "text": "It is He Who set for you the earth at creation in the order of a settled habitation where you establish your abode* and made the heaven with its regions, spheres, celestial bodies and realms of space a construction of imposing magnitude and He sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water and with it He caused the various products to spring from the soil**, products fit to be used as food for human sustenance. Therefore, employ your faculty of reason in forming conclusions and reason high of Providence and do not equal with Him deities haunting your imagination when the instinctive perception of the truth is natural to you"
