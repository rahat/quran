    "text": "Among you are those who truly deserve benefaction; they have been restrained from earning their livelihood because they participated in the war of belief against unbelief. They keep up appearances exhibiting to those unacquainted with them a happy expression and satisfaction because their modesty obstructs their tongues. You know them by their appearance speaking a different language; they do not solicit peoples’ ears for charity. And whatever you spend in divine service comes to Allah’s Knowledge"
