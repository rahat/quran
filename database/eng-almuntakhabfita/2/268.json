    "text": "AL-Shaytan deceives your judgement in order to cause falsity to be accepted as true, he threatens you with poverty in consequence for spending in divine service and he portrays to you what would insidiously allure your minds’ eyes and tempt you to commit morally evil acts whereas Allah promises you forgiveness from heaven’s realm and confers upon you efficacious grace. And Allah is Wasi‘un, His grace abounds in the universe, He is Alimun"
