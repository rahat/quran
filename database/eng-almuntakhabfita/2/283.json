    "text": "And if you are on a journey and cannot find a writer, then place a pledge in the creditorâ€™s possession as a guarantee of good faith. And if the debtor considers the creditor a credible person then the creditor should prove himself trustworthy and return the pledge upon receiving the debt from the debtor, also expected to be trustworthy, and either of them should keep Allah in mind and revere Him. And do not conceal, destroy, suppress or refuse to provide evidence when summoned, and he who withholds testimony is indeed morally depraved with a soiled and sinful heart. And Allah is 'Alimun of all you do"
