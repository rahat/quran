    "text": "And be strongly disposed to believe in the Quran I have been revealing, corroborating and authoritatively validating the authentic AL-Tawrah, which you possess. Yet it is indeed incredible that you have received it with incredulity and, of all people of faith, you are the first to deny it and refuse to give it solemn recognition. Do not then exchange the truth of My revelations and My Prophet for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world, and be careful not to come within the measure of My wrath nor neglect the profound reverence dutiful to Me"
