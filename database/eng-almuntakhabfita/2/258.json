    "text": "Have you not seen, O Muhammad, into the discourse of the one who argued with Ibrahim against Allah, his Creator, only because he was in a position of power over the kingdom bequeathed to his sovereignty by Allah? Ibrahim said: \"Allah is my Creator, He who gives life and determines the moment of death.\" The man said: \"I as well grant life and occasion death.\" Then Ibrahim said: \"Allah causes the sun to rise in the east, so then, cause it to rise from the west.\" And there the presumptuous infidel was thrown into confusion and defeat, and Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness"
