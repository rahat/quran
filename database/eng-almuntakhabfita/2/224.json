    "text": "And do not abuse Allah’s Eternal Name in acts of swearing when referring to Allah in binding you to a false statement or an act or in refusing to make peace. Make reparations for your oath and correct the incorrect so that reputations are maintained and piety is credited for the sake of reverence and the ability to create peace among people, and your affirmation is as sacred as an oath. Revere Allah; Who is Sami’un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun"
