    "text": "Meanwhile, announces O Muhammad, blissful tidings to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and there deeds wisdom and pious: that they shall be welcomed into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow. As often as they are offered any kind of the fruit therein, they express their thoughts in words: \"But this is what we had before in life for our livelihood.\" In effect, they are offered what bears a marked resemblance to what they had in life, but not of a like nature; it has the power to excite relish and ecstatic delight unexperienced before. And therein shall they be accompanied by mates of their design: pure, chaste and holy fellows of their piety and therein they will have passed through nature to Eternity"
