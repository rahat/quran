    "text": "And if you divorce them before consummating marriage but after already deciding on the dowerâ€™s amount, then they are entitled to half the determined amount unless they themselves, or their representatives, grant remission of the due amount. And to grant remission is nearer to piety. Do not forget to exercise good will among each other and to commit generosity, for the actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts. Allah is Bassirun, He sees all you do"
