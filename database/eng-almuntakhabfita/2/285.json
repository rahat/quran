    "text": "The Prophet strongly believes in all that has been revealed to him from Allah, his Creator. He pays credence to it and embraces it as truth personified. Similarly act the true believers who revere profoundly, they believe in Allah, His spiritual angels or attendants, His books and His Messengers. And they emphatically declare: \"We do not differentiate between one Prophet and another.\" And they beseech Allah for forgiveness with the following prayer of invocation: \"We have, O Allah, heard Your message with receptive hearts and venerated Your revelations and all enjoined, and we obey all Your statutes and ordinances You decreed. O Allah, our Creator, kindly grant Your mercy and forgiveness to us; You are the end of all destiny"
