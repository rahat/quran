    "text": "Then Ibrahim made a devout and humble supplication to Allah to bless the city of Macca. He prayed: “I beseech You, Allah, my Creator, to make this city a safe retreat affording security and peace of mind. And provision its people with the earth’s kind fruits favouring those among them who believed in Allah and in Day of Judgement with hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues.” “Quite the contrary”, Allah said, “but also he who shall be denied the heaven's bliss I will satisfy in life. I make him hold and enjoy the same to a predetermined point, then I will drive him into Hell. How evil is his destiny!”"
