    "text": "Remember that once We extended Our mercy to you redeeming you from the wilderness. We said to you: \"Make entry into this town â€“AL-Quds- and eat as you will, wherever you will; it is all replete with choice of all delights and enjoy all that is wholesome and affords pleasure. Humble yourselves and bow your knees to Me as you go through the gate and let your bosoms surge forth and answer thanks. Express your thoughts in words invoking Me to relieve your hearts and unload your burden of sins. We will forgive your iniquities and reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety"
