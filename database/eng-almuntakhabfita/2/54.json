Therefore, stand repentant in lowliest plight to Allah, your Creator, and slay the wrongful of action among you, then you will have pursued the acceptable course to Allah, your Creator.\" Yet Allah give up resentment against you and pardoned your offence; it is He Who always accepts true repentance and peopleâ€™s atonement and He is AL-Tawab (the Relenting) and AL-Rahim"
