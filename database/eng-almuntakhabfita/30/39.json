    "text": "And whatever you invest of money expecting interest or profit by way of usury to appropriate people's property wrongfully to yourselves is an ill- gotten gain which shall never yield an increment with Allah nor shall it ever grow with Him, like benevolence does and excessively. Whereas what you invest in charity or benevolence as an obligation to Allah and to satisfy your conscience shall Allah increase immeasurably and such persons are those to whom what is saved with Allah shall be redoubled to their credit"
