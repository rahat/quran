    "text": "Have they -the Meccans- not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them, who wore far mightier and their diligence never wearied! They broke up the earth and turned over the soil and populated and peopled the land far more than these people have done! Their Messengers presented them with convincing divine signs and revelations -but they closed their, minds' eyes and counselled deaf-. Therefore it was not Allah Who would wrong them but it was they who wronged themselves"
