    "chapter": 30,

    "text": "It is Allah Who sends the winds -carrying water vapour extracted* chiefly from the water mass on the surface of the earth- to raise clouds He spreads in the floor of the vault of heaven as He wills. Then He makes a cumulus or rounded masses heaped upon each other like towers or mountains where you see the rain drops issuing from within; And when He makes it light upon whom He wills of His servants they rejoice beyond a common joy"
