    "text": "And among His marvels is that He exhibits to view lightening or the electrical discharges between groups of clouds and between the clouds and the ground -mountains- which actuate you with the feeling of fear -might bring you suffering, strike you dead or engender a cyclonic storm and with the feeling of hope- of rainfalls to revive the land which has been pined with drought- And from the floor of the vault of heaven He sends water reviving the earth after it had suffered death. All precepts concerning Allah's Omnipotence and Authority are in effect comprehended in these signs by those who exercise sound judgment and have the ability to perceive and adopt the best means for accomplishing an end and who are characterized by good sense and prudence"
