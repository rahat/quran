    "text": "Do you -people- have part- owners among those you have on hand, be they captives or reduced to a servile state who go shares with you in what We bestowed on you of affluence and stand with you on equal terms and you fear them as you fear yourselves - for injustice and temptation for ill-gotten gain! Then how could you relate to Allah partners of His created beings?. Thus do We expound Our revelations distinctly expressing all that they meant leaving nothing merely implied to those who exercise sound judgment and have the ability to perceive and adopt the best means for accomplishing an end"
