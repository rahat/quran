    "text": "Allah of His mercy made your heart, O Muhammad, ever tender in the treatment of the calamity which they -your people- brought upon themselves in battle. He made you speak to them in the gentle voice of peace. Had you been unsparing in censure and reproof and harsh hearted, they would have broken the bonds of loyalty and would have broken away from you. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allahâ€™s mercy and consult with them upon matters of great moment, matters on which you received no divine authoritative instructions. So when you have caused a discord to pass into a concord and resolved on a course of action, then in Allah you trust, for Allah likes those who put their trust in Him"
