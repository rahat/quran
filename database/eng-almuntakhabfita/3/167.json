When they were asked to join the Muslim forces to fight in the cause of Allah or at least to defend their own interests; they made excuses. They said, \"We would gladly follow you if we knew how to fight.\" They were then furthermost from Allah and their words did not accord to their inmost thoughts. Allah knows best their secret feelings"
