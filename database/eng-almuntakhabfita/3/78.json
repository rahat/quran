    "text": "Among Ahl al-Kitab are some who seem to recite divine revelations documented in the Quran in jest to distort the words from common use. They expect to imprint on your minds that these are verses of the Quran, while in fact they are not. They relate them to Allah when in fact they are not Allahâ€™s words and they relate to Allah falsehood and they admit it into their minds"
