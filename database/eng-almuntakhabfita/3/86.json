    "text": "How shall Allah consent to guide a people who intentionally deny Him after they have recognized Him and bore witness to the truth of His Messenger's mission? How shall He guide them after they had received and accepted then later on rejected the clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition! Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness those who are wrongful of actions"
