    "text": "Nor can a soul be disembodied except by Allah’s permission according to a predetermined point of time that had been entered in a Book. He who so sets his mind upon the mundane things ministering to his enjoyment and content here below shall be requited with what is apportioned to him in this world. He who so sets his mind upon the divine things conducing to Allah’s mercy and grace Hereafter shall be requited with what is commensurate with his deeds of wisdom and piety. We will generously reward those who impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude"
