    "text": "They have been stamped with humiliation (The Jews) wherever they are found, except when they come to be under the tutelage of Allah and at peace with people. They came within the measure of Allahâ€™s wrath and they were stamped with mortification of pride. Their unjustifiable slaying of the Prophets was in the train of their defiance of piety. Their disobedience was natural to them that it became an addiction to transgression"
