    "text": "O you people whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: do not have as intimate associates a body of persons of another law; they shall not hesitate to pervert you. They eagerly wish to overthrow you or bring an irretrievable disaster upon you. Nature has written a letter of discredit upon their faces that reflect hatred; such a hatred that is portrayed in their thoughts which they express in words, but worse is what their bosoms conceal. We have made to you Our revelations clear and plain if only you have soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends"
