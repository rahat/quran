    "text": "All Scriptures were revealed earlier in the spirit of truth in order to guide people into all truth yet people set themselves at variance to them. So there came the Quran that is the standard and the canon illuminating the intellect and imparting the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends and in the choice of what is morally good, honest and straightforward. It guides into illumination and enlightenment. Therefore, those who disregard Allahâ€™s revelations and signs that He makes obvious to the senses, shall suffer grievously. Allah is Azizun (Almighty) He justly avenges His right"
