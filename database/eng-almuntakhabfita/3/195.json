    "text": "There did Allah respond favourably to their invocation and answer their prayer; He said \"Indeed I do not annul, withhold nor withdraw the fruit anyone, man or a woman, is entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety, you spring one from the other. Therefore, those who emigrated and were ousted from their homes and suffered in My cause and fought the war of belief against positive unbelief and have survived or been slain shall be entitled to a great reward. I will remit their deeds of an evil savour, I will welcome them in gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, a reward from Heaven, and in Allahâ€™s grace rest hope and mercy and the best reward"
