    "text": "If good fortune falls to you, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated by envy and grieved at heart. If you are befallen with a disaster or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy. If you be patient and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall not be hurt by their wicked plots and intrigues. Allah besets them on all sides and He is 'Alimun of all that they do"
