    "text": "It is hardly intelligible that a human on whom Allah confers the Book and the wisdom and the prerogative of Prophethood would demand of the people to worship him in lieu of Allah. Rather he would ask of them by virtue of right and authority to pay reverence and veneration to Allah, the Creator, and to adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and devotion. This is the logical sequence which Allah has imparted to them, the divine knowledge which they have imparted to people, the divine knowledge which they themselves have applied their minds to its acquisition"
