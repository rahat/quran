O Prophet exclaim: \"Allah Who has the absolute Sovereign Authority over the universe with all its realms, You confer sovereignty on whom You will and You divest it from whom You will. You ennoble whom You will and You humiliate whom You will. On the helm of Your hand rests goodness. You are Qadirun (Omnipotent) wholly capable of doing all things"
