    "text": "Certainly, among Ahl AL-Kitab are those who believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues; they give credence to all that has been revealed to you Muslims and to all that had been revealed to them. They humble themselves to Allah and never do they exchange the truth and the established divine principles for the worthless vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. Allah shall reward such people with what is generously commensurate with their deeds of wisdom and piety. Allah is swift indeed in putting the law into execution"
