    "text": "The day shall come when every soul shall be presented in the August presence with a vivid picture of the deeds imprinted in life with wisdom and piety, and with a written description of the evil that was wrought by want of thought, from which evil, the soul shall wish it was as far from as the earth's distant ends. Allah cautions you not to come within the measure of His wrath. Allah is the source of goodness, sympathy and kindness to His servants"
