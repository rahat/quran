    "text": "Belief is incompatible with Disbelief, therefore let those whose hearts have been touched by the divine hand refrain from favouring those infidels who deny Allah over their companions in religion. He who follows this irreverent course of action, Allah shall renounce, except under compelling circumstances, then exercise caution beforehand to provide against their mischief. Allah cautions you not to come within the measure of His wrath. Allah is the end and purpose for which all are destined"
