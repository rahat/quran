    "text": "O Muhammad, declare in explicit terms: We Muslims believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. We believe in all that has been imparted to us in the Quran and in all that was imparted to Ibrahim and Isma’il, to Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya’qub (Jacob) and to the tribes of his twelve sons and in what was imparted to Mussa and to ‘Isa. We believe in all that was imparted to all the Prophets from Allah, their Creator. We do not discriminate one from another and we conform our will to His blessed will. He is the heart of our purpose"
