    "text": "You forced your way up the hill paying attention to no one while the Prophet in the rear convoked you to come to fight. There, did Allah requite you with grief, upon grief, for being balked of your booty and for fleeing in the face of danger, so that you would learn not to grieve for what you miss nor to despair for what befalls you. Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do"
