    "text": "He shall be a Messenger to Bani Isra‘il, conveying acts of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate his delegated divine power and authority to influence their conduct and their actions. He shall be instructed to say to them \"I have brought you an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. I shall create for you from clay the figure of a bird and bring it to life and there it shall be a living bird by Allah’s command. I shall restore the sight of the man who is congenitally blind and heal the leper, and with delegated divine authority I shall raise the dead by Allah’s command. I shall also inform you of what you eat and of what you store in reserve in your homes. This should be enough divine evidence to bring you to acknowledge the truth of my mission if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
