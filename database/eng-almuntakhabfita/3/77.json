    "text": "Those who exchange Allah’s covenant or a vow to heaven or an oath that is binding for a miserable price featured in the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world shall be denied Allah’s grace Hereafter. Nor shall Allah address them, or look at them on the Day of Resurrection. He shall not bless them, and there awaits them a severe punishment"
