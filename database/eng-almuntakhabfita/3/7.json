    "text": "It is He who has revealed to you O Muhammad; the Quran with revelations that are precise and exactly defined. These constitute the essential part and the fundamental or groundwork of Allah’s system of faith and worship and unequivocal understanding and obedience from every intellectual being. Other revelations are allegorical. They describe a subject under the guise of some other comparable subject. Those with malignant and perverse hearts choose to follow only the allegories to interpret them as they please. Motivated by malice, they present the interpretation that causes dissension and includes discord when no one knows the exact interpretation but Allah. But those with well – founded knowledge, acquainted with the facts, declare their firm belief in the Quran and express their thoughts in words: \"It is all disclosed by Providence.\" But none reflect except those with sound minds"
