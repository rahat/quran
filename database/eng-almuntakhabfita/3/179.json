    "text": "It was never in the set of Allahâ€™s correlated principles to let those who conformed to Islam remain in this present state which is a combination of circumstances and attributes, but only to segregate the bad from the good, expose the malevolent and distinguish the benevolent. Nor did Allah intend to endow you people with the prerogative of divination nor with power of knowing the unknown or realizing the unseen or the invisible. Yet He chooses from His Prophets whom He will and gives them knowledge of events to come according to His will. Therefore, believe you people in Allah and give credence to His Prophets, for if you believe with hearts that reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, you shall be requited with a great reward"
