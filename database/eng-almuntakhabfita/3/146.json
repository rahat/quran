    "text": "A good many of the Prophets fought against positive disbelief and with them fought countless numbers of devotees whose hearts had been touched with the divine hand. Never did they falter in consequence of the misfortunes they experienced in the cause of Allah, nor were they disheartened or dispirited, nor did they acknowledge themselves beaten. Allah likes the patient who are unwearied in the face of difficulties"
