    "text": "Among Ahl al-Kitab there is he whom you can entrust with a cental of gold and he would return it to you on demand. Also among them is he who if entrusted with one single dinar, would not return it unless you keep asking and he may eventually be pronounced a defaulter. This is by reason of their folly and want of sense that they interpret in words. \"We are not,\" they say, \"under any obligation to these illiterate faithless people -the Muslims-\" and they intentionally relate to Allah falsehood which they admit into their minds"
