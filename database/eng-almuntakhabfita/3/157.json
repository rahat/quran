    "text": "If you are slain in the course of a hostile encounter between belief and positive unbelief or you die in battle or from another cause, you will have merited Allah’s forgiveness and mercy. This outweighs all that you might have earned or accumulated had you been carried through the stealing steps of age into advanced life. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy"
