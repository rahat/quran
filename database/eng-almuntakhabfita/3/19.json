    "text": "The religion, the system of faith and worship, commended by Allah is Islam or the recognition on the part of man of Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority and His power to control destiny besides acceptance of this feeling as a standard of spiritual and practical life. Yet not until they had received the divine discourse and intellectual acquaintance of the truth did Ahl al-Kitab fall into dispute and become divided through mutual envy and ill intention. He who disregards Allah’s revelations and visible signs shall find that Allah is indeed swift in putting the law in execution"
