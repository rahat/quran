    "text": "Allah has been gracious to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand. He raised in their midst a Messenger who is related to them by kinship and by spiritual qualities into which they all entered. He is a Messenger who shall recite to them His revelations, impart sanctity to them and teach them the Book -the Quran- and acquaint their hearts with wisdom, notwithstanding that they were once lost in the maze of error and liberally swam in immoral pleasure"
