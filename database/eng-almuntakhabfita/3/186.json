    "text": "You people shall be afflicted with some disagreeable events and misfortunes to test your qualities. You shall experience loss in wealth and in lives and you shall hear injuriously contemptuous insults from those who received the Book before you as well as from those who incorporate with Allah other deities. If you are patient and forbearing and you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you will have then considered matters with an attitude of mind reflecting high spirit and strong will"
