    "text": "Nor should those who are unwilling to spend in divine service of what Allah conferred on them consider this tight fisted disposition an advantage to them. To the contrary, it is an injury to their interest and prejudice to their credit. They shall be fitted round their necks in Day of Judgement with the insignia of what they hoarded. To Allah shall be the inheritance of the realms of the Heavens and the Earth, and Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do"
