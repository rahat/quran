    "text": "It is not a Prophet who would appropriate spoils or anything else to wrong uses or apply it dishonestly to his own use. Nor would he ever betray the trust or the one who trusted him. He who withholds from anyone what is his, by right, shall carry in Day of Judgement the insignia of fraud and misappropriation when every soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and no one shall be wronged"
