Others were aroused to emotion, which begot unjust suspicion of Allah, and a state of mind characteristic of ignorance - analogous to the ignorance induced by paganism. The latter keep their thoughts to themselves and do not express them to you O Muhammad and they say to themselves: \"If we had a say in the matter we would never have been slain here in battle!\" Say to them: \"Had you decided to be the stay- at- home, those of you predestined to be slain would have emerged to the sites of their interment.\" Such a train of events, Allah has ordained to expose your actions interpreting your thoughts, and to test your innermost being for such a disposition as your hearts and minds would incline you to propound. Allah is 'Alimun of all that is stored in the bosoms"
