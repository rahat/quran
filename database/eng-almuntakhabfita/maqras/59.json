He brought into being the palm trees and the whole of the agricultural yield of every district and season, varying in kind and in flavour, and the olives and the pomegranates besides many others of similar species and dissimilar class. Eat, therefore, of their flowers when they come to be fruits and grow ripe and pay, when you reap in harvest, what ought to be given in benevolence or in alms, but avoid prodigality, for Allah does not like the extravagant"

Thus they dedicate what sheep and goats, camels and oxen carry in their wombs to their males and exclude their females; a concept bringing Us to eight copulatory mates. Four of them are a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Ask them O Muhammad: \"Is it the two males or the two females that Allah has forbidden or is it what both females carry in their wombs! \"Tell me who gave you this authority that you speak like a book if indeed you are declaring the truth"

Indeed Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the vicious and wrongful of actions"
