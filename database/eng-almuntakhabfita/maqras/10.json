Therefore, he who goes on AL-Hajj (pilgrimage) to the Sacred Mosque or on the minor Hajj, the ‘Umra, incurs no blame to go round in procession, and he who offers of his own accord to perform this virtuous rite shall find Allah responsive to pious actions. Indeed, Allah acknowledges what is esteemed a worthy deed; He is 'Alimun"
