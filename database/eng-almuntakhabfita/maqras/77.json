Therefore, do not wrong yourselves during this period of time nor discredit yourselves by word or thought. And fight the idolaters in the whole as they fight you in the whole and do realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"

Such a practice, as being adopted by the Pagans, made them sink deeper under the vexation of their minds; they permit it one year and forbid it another year so as to adjust means to ends and arrange them suitably to the number ordained by Allah, a practice that sets them at defiance with Allah in as much as it permits a course of action forbidden by Him. Thus were the Pagans enticed by their deeds of evil and iniquity that allured their minds' eyes and induced them to hug their irreverent conviction to their hearts and were swayed from the path of righteousness. Allah never guides to His path of righteousness the infidels whose aim is to defy Him"

Prompted by Allah and actuated by divine influence he left home with no one but his companion* to whom he was his second. In the cave** where they both hid, He said to his companion: Rest assured and do not grieve; we are not two but three; Allah is in our presence There and then did Allah inspire peace and tranquility as well as just confidence to the heart and mind of His Messenger and the thoughts were conveyed to one another, and He upheld him and supported him with an invisible array of angels. There, did Allah make what the infidels had forged in their breasts to what their tongues have vented fail to accord. Thus, was what they declared in words debased and the Word of Allah, supreme and dominant, is as always at the top; Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun"
