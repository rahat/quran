Therefore, you had better believe in Allah and acknowledge His Messengers and stop saying \"Allah in Trinity;\" this is only to your benefit.

And if the deceased in question has two sisters or more, then they go share and share alike in two thirds of what he left. And if they are a mixed company of men and women - brothers and sisters, then the general principle of inheritance applies; the male inherits the equivalent of what is apportioned to two females. Allah sets forth for you in detail the principles governing hereditary succession to property so that you do not go wrong, and Allah is 'Alimun of all in all"
