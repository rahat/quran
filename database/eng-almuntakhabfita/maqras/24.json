Also among them is he who if entrusted with one single dinar, would not return it unless you keep asking and he may eventually be pronounced a defaulter. This is by reason of their folly and want of sense that they interpret in words. \"We are not,\" they say, \"under any obligation to these illiterate faithless people -the Muslims-\" and they intentionally relate to Allah falsehood which they admit into their minds"

This is the logical sequence which Allah has imparted to them, the divine knowledge which they have imparted to people, the divine knowledge which they themselves have applied their minds to its acquisition"
