They should not be like those who have been given the Book before them who have transmuted the Book to their purpose throughout the years and became hard hearted? Indeed many among them are wicked"

Then come the pious who carried the banners of truth at odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of \"Martyrs\" through resisting to blood with their spiritual armour. Both of them are they who have been destined to enjoy such designations in the heavens realm There await them a meritorious reward and light emanating from Allah's countenance to glow in their faces and proceed ahead of them But those who denied Allah and refused to recognize His revelations are those who shall make their abode in hell"

A succession of events similar to a land that has been tilled and cultivated by those who care only for the material harvest and counsel deaf to spiritual harvest. Then it rained, and the crops grew delightfully well and to their hearts desire. Then suddenly the crops lost their bloom and natural colour, turned yellow then dried up, shriveled and decayed. Likewise, in the Hereafter there is a condign punishment, but also forgiveness and fulfillment of desire; and life here is but an animate existence affording pleasure deceiving those with foolish credulous ambition and vain employment of time"
