Yet those who disputed its precepts were the same who were given the Book (Ahl Al-Kitab) imparting enough signs guiding them into illumination and mental enlightenment. But they were no longer disposed to the truth due to their mutual enmity and malignant intention. Nonetheless, Allah will guide the truth-seeking believers to His path.
