They strive in His cause whether they gain victory or be martyrized in His cause. It is a solemn promise Allah has pledged in AL-Tawrah (the Torah), AL-Injil (the Gospel) and the Quran, and who can honour and fulfill his promise better than Allah. Therefore, you may rejoice O Muslims at the bargain you have made to your advantage; This is indeed triumph supreme"
