There and then were they stamped with humiliation and misery and came within the measure of Allah's wrath. This was in the train of their denial of Allah's revelations and signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority and of bringing death unjustifiably upon the Prophets of their own nation. Such vices were a sequel to the disobedience natural to them that it drew after it their addiction to transgression"
