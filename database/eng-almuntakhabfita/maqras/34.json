And they direct to you the words superficially denoting politeness and deep respect that you think they are saying: \"We need you to apply your mind and your ears to us, and you are excused if you do not listen, but please attend to us.\" In point of fact the way they pronounce the words with their tongues in their cheeks (or in Hebrew) admits of secondary bad meaning and insult of the religion, thus: Listen, may you never hear and be afflicted with deafness, you are a thoughtless bad one. But had they said: \"We open to you our hearts' ears and we obey, please listen to us and “unzurna” and direct your intellectual eye upon us;\" it would have been much better for them and indeed honourable. But Allah has cursed them for their disobedience and their infidelity; how greatly shaken is their faith in Allah"
