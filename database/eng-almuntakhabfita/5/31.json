There and then did Allah send a raven to remove earth with its claws to bury a dead raven so that the killer would know how to dispose of his brother's corpse? The raven having shamed him with its notable performance, he said: \"Woe betide me; have I not been even able to be like this raven to dispose of my brotherâ€™s corpse and obstruct the view of my crime! \" And there he was left with nothing but pining regrets and vain repentance"
