    "text": "O you whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Do not desecrate Allah’s religious rites* nor violate the Sacred Month** (unless attacked) or interfere with the offerings, nor disturb the garlands mantling them identifying the sacrifice nor obstruct the way against those seeking grace, being bound for the Sacrosanct House betaking themselves to Providence for His bounty. And when you have concluded the proceedings of Allah’s religious rites and divested yourselves of the pilgrim's garb and moved away from the environs of the Sacrosanct House, you may engage in the chase if you like. And let not your hatred of a people, once your enemies who malevolently obstructed your way to the Sacrosanct House, stir your emotions to retaliate. And unite in good will to effectuate moral virtue and piety and not in sin, transgression and impiety, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Who punishes severely"
