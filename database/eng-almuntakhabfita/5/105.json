    "text": "Begin with yourselves and invest your own souls with such religious and spiritual virtues as Allah has inclined you to propound and guard yourselves from being supposed, then no one who deviates in mind can possibly pervert you nor alienate you from Allahâ€™s purpose, provided you lift to Him your inward sight and maintain His path of righteousness where Providence is the guide. You are all destined to go back to Allah Who shall inform you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do"
