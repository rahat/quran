    "text": "O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Keep to your word and fulfill the obligations to Allah and to one another an oath, a promise, a contract, an agreement, a duty, matrimony, conduct, an act and the like. Commandments expressed by Allah represent His will relative to the conduct of His intelligent creatures. Thus, Allah rendered lawful the flesh of camels, cows, sheep and the live animals reared for food excepting those designated forbidden. Nor are you permitted to chase wild animals or game while you are on pilgrimage -major or minor- nor in the environs of the Sacrosanct Mosque. Allah ordains what He will"
