    "text": "O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues : Stand guard over Allahâ€™s purpose and make it your aim. And when you are called upon to bear witness to an incident or to a statement or the like, let your attestation be applied to the inward testimony of the conscience reflecting justice and equity. And let not your hatred of a people induce you to injustice. Assert the truth and be consonant with the principle of moral right, and remember that justice is closely associated with piety and that only the actions of the just smell sweet and blossom in the dust. And entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He is 'Alimun of all that you do"
