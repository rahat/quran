    "text": "And you see those hypocrites whose ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, hasten on to win their tutelage and they interpret their thoughts in words, Thus: \"We fear,\" they say, \"lest one day fortune be on their side and we should be overcome and suffer at their hands\". May Allah make victory sit on your helm O Muslims or take matters of fact and circumstance them after His own manner; there and then shall the hypocrites be really sorry and pained at heart for having succumbed to their evil thoughts"
