    "text": "Say to them: O you Ahl AL-Kitab, you bend on a system of faith not standing upon the vantage ground of truth until you comply with the precepts of AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and all that has been sent down to you from Allah, your Creator. But the more Allah bestows on you O Muhammad of His bounty, the more do many of them err for infirmity of purpose and display their transgressive infirmities of themselves and sink deeper in infidelity under the vexations of their minds. Therefore, do not grieve over those who are infidels indeed"
