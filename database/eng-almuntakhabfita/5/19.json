    "text": "O you Ahl AL-Kitab: There came to you Our Prophet after a period of time - about six hundred years- intervening between him and his predecessor, to make intelligible, to you the facts and help you abandon imagination often at war with reason and fact so that you will not claim innocence saying: \"No one came to us in the capacity of a spectacle and a warning\". There he is -the Prophet Muhammad- in your midst, who has been sent to you all as a spectacle and a warning, and Allah is Qadirun to effect all in all"
