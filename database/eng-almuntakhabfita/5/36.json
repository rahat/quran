    "text": "Those who deny Allah shall be paid their deserts. If they had owned twice the worldly riches and the affluence treasured on earth to offer in expiation of their guilt and of the torment to be laid on the damned in Day of Judgment, shall find that their hopes are doomed to disappointment. Never shall their ransom be accepted and there awaits them an unremitting punishment"
