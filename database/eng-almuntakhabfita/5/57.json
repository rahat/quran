    "text": "O You who have conformed to Islam: Do not take defenders, supporters, or intimate friends from among those given the Book before you, nor from the infidels who are at enmity with your faith. It is incumbent on you to deny their tutelage. They mock your religion and amuse themselves with its principles. You just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
