    "text": "Then shall Allah address ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, thus: \"Do you remember O ‘Isa My divine favour and the efficacious grace I conferred on you and on your mother; how I supported you and gave you countenance by the Holy Spirit Jibril that you spoke to people while in the cradle and in manhood. And I taught you the Book and wisdom, AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and made you present your people with an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace featured in the power I imparted to you to create from clay the figure of a bird and inspirit it and it came to be a living bird by My command and made you restore the sight of the congenitally blind and heal the leper by My command, and with My delegated authority raise the dead by My command. And do you remember how I held back Bani Isra‘il from their intended hostile course of action against you when you presented them with divine clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into intellectual illumination and enlightenment, but the infidels among them said: This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him"
