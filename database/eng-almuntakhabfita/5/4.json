Say to them: Allah has rendered lawful what is worthy, good and wholesome, and the prey of the trained beasts of chase - animal or bird- trained to go in chase of the game you hunt as hounds are trained in the manner Allah has taught you; you may eat the flesh of the game they catch but under the invocation of Allahâ€™s Name over it when you release the hound and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Allah is swift indeed in executing the law"
