    "text": "As of this day has Allah rendered lawful for you all articles of food that are worthy, good and wholesome, and the food of Ahl AL-Kitab as your food is to them. And it is lawful for you to marry the virtuous Muslim women and women among those who had been given the Book before you(Ahl Al-Kitab) who lift to Allah their inward sight when you have paid them their due dowers intending to live together in matrimony and not as illicit partners nor as concubines. And those who reject faith shall their hopes be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter where they shall be among the great losers"
