    "text": "Yet, set to their discredit was the crime of breaking the divine covenant which brought them within the measure of Allah’s wrath; We poured upon them maledictions and rendered them hard-hearted. They translocation the words of the Sacred Scriptures to alter Allah’s words and willfully neglect a part of what was imparted to them. And thus still you sense O Muhammad deception as the principal ingredient in their disposition with the excepting a few among them who lift to Allah their inward sight. Nonetheless, accord them forgiveness and do not entertain them with thoughts of ill-will; Allah likes those who turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence"
