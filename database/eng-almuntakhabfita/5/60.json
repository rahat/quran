Accordingly, Allah had decreed they be monkyfied and vested with swinish disposition and their monkey and swine-like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt and they be despised and rejected of men and be worshippers of idols. These and such persons have indeed assumed the worst position in society here and Hereafter and strayed far away from the path of righteousness"
