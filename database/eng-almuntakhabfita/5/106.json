    "text": "O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: when any of you feels death impending and he wishes to make a bequest, then witness action is mandatory. Two of your just men known to recourse to justice are summoned to witness the action. And in the event of being on a journey when the calamity of death befalls you, then two other men are duly detained following the funerary prayer to establish the point in question. And if you should apprehend guilt or fault on their part, then they are asked to perform the act of worship and then be sworn, thus: \"We swear by Allah that we have no selfish motive principles nor do we favour anyone for a gain, even if he be within the first degree of consanguinity, nor will we hide or suppress testimony a divine duty, and be wrongful of actions"
