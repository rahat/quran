    "text": "You shall find O Muhammad the most avowed enemy to those who conformed their will to Allah’s will arc the Jews and those who incorporate with Allah other deities. And you shall find that the people who have a better disposition toward those who conformed their will to Allah’s will are those who are Christians. This is because among them, there are priests and monks who fear Allah and not extravagant in their accounts of themselves nor do they entertain inordinate self-esteem"
