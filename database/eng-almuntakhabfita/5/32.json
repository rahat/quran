    "text": "By reason of this We ordained to Bani Israâ€˜il thus: \"He who deprives an innocent life not implicated in homicide, corruption or mischief on earth, will have committed, as it were, massacre of all innocent people\". \"And he who preserves it and defends it will have protected, as it were, all innocent people\". Our Messengers came to them equipped with clear signs to implement Our statues, yet many among them continued to carry disobedience and mischief to excess"
