    "text": "O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Do not take the Jews and the Christians -when warring against you- as intimate friends nor favour their tutelage; they both act in concert to set themselves as your antagonists, and their ill-will unites their thoughts. And he who favours their tutelage shall be counted as one of them; Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness"
