    "text": "We have sent down AL-Tawrah with emphasis on the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and to bring intellectual illumination and enlightenment. We made it the standard of judgement and the canon law by which the Prophets, who conformed to Islam, would administer righteousness and justice between the Jews. And so would the rabbins and the canonists who were entrusted with it as the guide Book where Providence is the guide and were witnesses to its divinity. Therefore, do not fear the people but fear me. Nor should you exchange the truth of my revelations and of -the mission of My Messenger- for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. And remember that he, who does not judge matters according to the rules revealed by Allah, will have denied Allah. Such persons are indeed infidels"
