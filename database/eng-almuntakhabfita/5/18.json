    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say: \"We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones\". Say to them Muhammad: \"Why then does He punish you and afflict you with pain and suffering in requital for your evil deeds! Indeed you are but creatures constituting a part of those He brought into being and caused to exist. He forgives whom He will and torments whom He will. To Him alone belong all that is in the heavens and on earth and all in between. He is the end and the purpose for which all are destined"
