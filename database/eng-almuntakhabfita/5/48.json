    "text": "And We have sent down to you O Muhammad the Quran confirming the Scriptures revealed before it -AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil- and serving as the Book of reference for matters disputed among Ahl AL-Kitab, for it is the umpire of all preceding Scriptures, and the decision based on its precepts shall have to be, accepted as final. Therefore, base your Judgments Muhammad on its precepts revealed by Allah, and do not follow their desires which deviate from the truth imparted to you. In fact, for each of you people Jews, Christians and Muslims have We authoritatively determined a law and a course to follow, and had Allah willed, He would have made all of you one conjoint body united in feeling and thought. But He meant to test your qualities with what He has ordained for-you. Therefore, contend you people for good will and for deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety; you are all destined to go back to Allah, and there and then shall He inform you of the detailed particulars of all the points upon which the whole unreasoning turned"
