    "text": "To Him, the Ultimate source and Authority is attributed the knowledge of the point of time of the predetermined and Eventful Hour. And no blossoms come out of their calyces as seeds or fruits, nor does a female - human or animal- conceive a seed in her womb or gives birth to - a child or an animal respectively - but come to His knowledge. And there shall come the Day when He - Allah- calls them up-the infidels - to bring into their minds those whom they incorporated with Him. There and then shall they say: \"We truly acknowledge, by way of reparations, our offence which we do regret and none of us can bear witness to a corporate deity"
