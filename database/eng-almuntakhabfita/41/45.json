    "text": "We gave Mussa (Moses) the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and there it was met with disagreement; it was not in accordance with some of his people's taste and liking; it excited their displeasure and disgust. And had it not been for Allah's Word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment of your opponents O Muhammad in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. They are in perplexity about it -the Quran- with suspicions amongst their thoughts"
