    "text": "Had We made it a Quran in a literary form that is ambiguous, un understandable and foreign to their thoughts, they would have said: \"If only its revelations and precepts were expounded so that We could apprehend the intended tense!\" How is it that We render it in a literary form foreign to people's thoughts when it is addressed to an Arab! Say to them :. \" It -the Quran- is the spirit of truth guiding those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand into all truth. Its inherent heavenly power exerts a remedying effect on their minds to counteract doubt and redress uncertainties; whereas to those who deny it, and their heart's ears are deaf, it exerts a blinding effect on their intellectual and spiritual perception. These are they who seem to be called upon from afar as the earth's distant ends; they are also distant from Allah's blessed abode"
