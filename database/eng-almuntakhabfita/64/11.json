    "text": "No calamity befalls a soul but by the leave of Allah. He who believes in Allah with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and receives the blow without antipathy, as an act of Allah, realizing that in patience possesses he his soul, will Allah, the Spirit of truth, guide him into all truth and imprint his breast with reverential awe. Allah is Alimun of all things"
