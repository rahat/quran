    "text": "These events were in the train of their response to their Messengers who brought them all the facts bearing witness to the truth and serving as a ground for belief; they made considerable efforts to bring them to themselves so that the spirit of truth would guide them into all truth. But they said: \"How could it be so! shall we be steered by the guidance of mortals?\" And so they refused to recognize Allah and they turned up their noses and turned a deaf ear. Allah ignored them and left them out of consideration; and Allah is Ghaiyun (Independent, Absolute) and Hamidun (Worthy of all praise)"
