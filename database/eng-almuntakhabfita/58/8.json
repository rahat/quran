    "text": "Do you see O Muhammad how those who were forbidden secret counsels turn their minds back to what they have been forbidden to do? They convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk uttered below their breath, reticent about their intentions of secretly promoting the evil forged in their bosoms that their tongues must vent. They encourage aggression upon others and disobedience to the Messenger. When they come to you they greet you with expressions of ill-will unlike that with which Allah greets you, and they suggest secretly to their minds: \"if he is truly a Messenger of Allah would Allah not punish us on his behalf?\" Hell awaits them to be put to the torture, and how evil is the destination"
