    "text": "You shall not find a people, true and solemn believers, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety and minds conscious of the Last Day, who would have intimate friendship with those who challenge Allah and His Messenger, albeit they be their fathers or sons, their brothers or relatives. These are people whose hearts has Allah inscribed with the justification of Faith as a conviction operative on their character and will; He has given them moral support, courage and just confidence. He shall welcome them to His heaven's realm and admit them into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, and in the beatitude of heaven they shall experience that vast forever. Allah has been pleased with them and they with Him. These are members of the Divine party; and who would heaven prosper better than the partisans of this party who are zealous supporters of the cause of Allah which is the heart of His purpose"
