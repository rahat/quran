    "text": "O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: when you are in an assembly and you are requested to move a little to make room for a new comer, do move and spread out; Allah widens your scope and the good may become best. And when you are asked to rise, do rise; Allah will raise those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of piety, as well as those men of learning and profitable knowledge, to higher ranks and exalt them in dignity and power. Allah is well acquainted with all that you do"
