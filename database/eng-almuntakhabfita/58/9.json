    "text": "O you whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand: if you secretly counsel with each other and you are reticent about your intentions, do not entertain the thoughts of evil and aggression nor of disobedience to the Messenger, but let your principles and your practice together accord. Your purpose should be the promotion of piety and habitual reverence and obedience to Allah and faithfulness to the duties naturally owed to Him, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah since to Him you shall be thronged"
