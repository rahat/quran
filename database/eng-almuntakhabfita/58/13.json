    "text": "How is it that back you recoiled, afraid of the acts of charity incumbent: on you before you took counsel with the Messenger! So you stopped taking private counsel, and Allah relented and quit you all His debt. But then, you must observe your prayers and give the alms and obey Allah and His Messenger; Allah is well acquainted with all that you do"
