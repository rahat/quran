But lawful unto you are all who are beyond this limiting provision, with the proviso that you seek to win, with your resources, the women of your choice to unite with them according to Islamic laws of matrimony and not according to vicious indulgence in sexual pleasures. And pay those of them whom you shall enjoy, their dowers; it is a duty incurred by such bond. Nonetheless you shall not fall into consequence if you mutually agree to give her more than what you have dutifully paid or you take back from her what she wishes to remit of her own accord; indeed Allah has always been 'Alimun and Hakimun"

You take them in marriage by permission of their guardians and pay them themselves, their dowers with good will, and choose those of them who are characterized with the attribute of chastity, faith and fidelity and ornamented with the flower of honesty and not enamoured of other men. And when once they are united in wedlock, they have to guard-themselves from being supposed (temptation). And should they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, then they shall suffer for their offence, but their punishment shall be half that inflicted on free women for the same offence. Such course of action is ordained for those who are afraid to live in celibacy lest they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and incur the undesirable consequence. And if you be patient and quietly await the course of events, it is better for you, and Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"

They feared the enemy –to a degree comparable to the degree of fear due to Allah–Creator of all beings or even a degree higher, and they exclaimed against fighting; they said: \"O Allah, our Creator, why enjoin us to fight and implant our Hereafter in the now; if only You would put fighting in respite and grant us a postponement of this obligation to a future date!\" Say to them O Muhammad: \"The enjoyment experienced here below, no matter how long it lasts, is fleeting and evanescent whereas the Hereafter abounds in the best enjoyments and everlasting bliss for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, and no one is ever wronged not even to the equivalent of a single hair of the dry integument of the smallest seed"
