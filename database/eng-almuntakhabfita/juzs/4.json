Among you are those who are concerned only with the interests and pleasures of life below and its mundane things, and others whose main concern is Allah’s grace Hereafter. Then did Allah distract your minds and your attention and made you draw off from the battle field to test your true inclination and He afforded you forgiveness. Allah’s bounty abounds in those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
