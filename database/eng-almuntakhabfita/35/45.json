    "text": "If Allah were to plant the People's Hereafter in the now and impose on them what is commensurate with their deeds, not one single earthling animate being would be left on its surface. But He mercifully respites them to a predetermined point of time that they might hopefully deviate into sense and turn to Him. When it is time to pay to nature their due debt they shall come to know that Allah has always been Bassirun keeping a vigilant eye upon all this created beings"
