We will imprint our deeds with wisdom and piety contrary to the wrong and the evil We did before. But they shall be told. \"Did We not give you life long enough to give a chance to him who was willing to open his heart's ears and to lift to Allah his inward sight!. You received Allah's Messengers who warned you of this unbearable Eventful Event! Therefore, you taste the fatal consequences and do not expect any one to afford you help"
