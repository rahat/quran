    "text": "Should Allah open His gates of mercy to the people -in the form of the material or the immaterial- no one can close these gates or obstruct the flow of what He has permitted nor be able to withhold it either. And if He should withhold it -in one form or another- no one can accord it besides Him; He is AL- Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)"
