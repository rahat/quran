    "text": "Does he who is enticed by his deeds of evil and iniquities alluring his mind's eyes and inducing him to hug his irreverent conviction to his heart compare with him whose deeds reflect wisdom and piety! Allah misguides indeed whom He will and guides to His path of righteousness whom He will. Therefore, do not let yourself O Muhammad be affected with grief and deep sorrow for their irreverent response to the divine message nor should you lament their deviation from sense with sighing Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient indeed of all that they do)"
