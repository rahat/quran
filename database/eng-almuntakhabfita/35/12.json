    "text": "Nor do the two kinds of flowing waters compare: one fresh and sweet pleasant to drink and the other salty and bitter, and from each do you eat tender meat and you obtain various kinds of gems you use as articles of ornaments carried on your bodies. And you see the ships -the large sea-going vessels and the river- boats- ploughing through the waves and cleaving the surface thereof to help you accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge and answer thanks"
