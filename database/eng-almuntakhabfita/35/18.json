    "text": "Nor would a soul heavily laden with wrongs find a single one to disburden her of some of her wrongs, nor the least of her burden be carried by any one else even if related by consanguinity. Your admonition and warning O Muhammad take effect with those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah albeit they do not apprehend Him by sight and they attend to religious Observances. And he who presents himself with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety will have successfully saved his own soul, and to Allah is the final and inevitable destination"
