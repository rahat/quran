    "text": "And We made the Book an heritage We bequeathed to such of Our servants as We have chosen and taken by preference. Some of them, the wrongful of actions, are being unfair to themselves. Others choose a middle way between right and wrong and some do vie by the grace of Allah in doing all that is good and all that reflects wisdom and piety. This is indeed the sufficient grace abounding in whom He will as well as the efficacious grace which effects the end for which it is given"
