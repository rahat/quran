Therefore, he who rejects the truth and denies the divine origin of the message will have hurt himself with his infidelity and nothing infidelity adds to the infidels' debit in heaven's realm but hatred and aversions And nothing infidelity adds to their fate but loss and ruin and moral and spiritual damnation"
