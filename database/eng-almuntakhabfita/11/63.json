Then, how can I neglect the duty of relating His message to the people when it has been entrusted to me. This shall be disobedience\". \"if I am to disobey Allah, who then can save me from His punishment!\" \"You people are simply trying to lead me into error and make me lose my way and incur privation of Allah's mercy"
