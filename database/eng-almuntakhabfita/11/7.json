    "text": "He is it who created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence in six days* determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar; His Throne of supremacy and dominion and of grace and mercy was then set over the water** He created the universe and you people as a part of it in Order to determine which of you performs the better deed and whether his deeds agree with his words and whether his work is imprinted with wisdom and piety! Yet when you O Muhammad say to them that they shall rise again at the Last Day after they had been dead and buried, the infidels shall say: \" This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him"
