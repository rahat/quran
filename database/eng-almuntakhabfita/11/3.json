    "text": "And you had better invoke Allah, your Creator, for forgiveness and in lowliest plight do stand to Him repentant of the way you conduct yourselves in life. He shall make you enjoy good things in life up to a predetermined point of time\". \"He shall bestow on every one of merit, here below, His divine favour that is commensurate with his merits and shall His grace abound in those entitled to it Hereafter\" And should they turn a deaf ear, then say to them: \"I only fear for you the punishment which shall be laid upon the damned on an unbearably Momentous Day"
