    "text": "When Our commend came to pass, We rescued Shuaib together with those who gave credence to his mission and acknowledged Allah's message, an act of mercy vouchsafed by us to whom We bless. And how direful was the one cry* from heaven's realm stirring up a merciless blast which overtook the wrongful of actions.
