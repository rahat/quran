    "text": "They -the infidels- bend their chests to hide, as it were, their thoughts and feelings from Allah! Do they not realize that even when they clothe themselves taking to their beds and lurk themselves enshrouded in the Veil of night, that Allah does know all that their bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and all that they suggest secretly to their minds, He is well acquainted with all that they utter loudly and with what they whisper below their breath! Indeed Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all private thoughts and feelings riposted in the breasts"
