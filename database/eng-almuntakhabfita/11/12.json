    "text": "You Muhammad seem inclined to omit the recital of a part of what is revealed to you, the part that depresses your spirits and oppresses your thoughts and feelings because it is not to the infidel's liking. You think that by so doing, Allah's message of truth would be accepted more readily and the infidels shall not use the usual formula of insolence and say: \"If only a treasure were sent down to him from heaven or an angel to companion him, we may be induced to recognize his mission\". You must realize that you are only a spectacle and a warning, and Allah is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all"
