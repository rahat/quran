    "text": "These infidels and such persons are not in a position ever to overpower Allah nor escape-His retributive punishment. Nor do they have besides Him tutelary protectors to defend them. Their punishment shall be doubled in the train of their obstinacy against divine laws, their adherence to their opinions with their usual struggle to assert falsehood and obstruct the way to Allah's path of righteousness and of their persistence in closing their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes to Allah's discourse"
