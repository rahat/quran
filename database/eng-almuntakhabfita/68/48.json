    "text": "So be patient O Muhammad and forbear their faults and limitations until Allah judges between you and them. Be not like (Zun Nun) (Jonah ) who fled his people because of their hostility and neglected his responsibility toward Allah. He went to the sea only to be swallowed by the fish. And in distress and utter darkness, he invoked Allahâ€™s forgiveness and mercy"
