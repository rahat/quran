    "text": "And those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds - wisdom and piety, and their progeny walked after them accepting their authority and example in faith, even thus their deeds be of a lesser calibre, will still be fitted for companionship together without being an expense to their fathers, and without making inroads on justice, for this is only Allah's grace. He confers it on whom He will, and every soul shall be pledged for its deeds"
