    "text": "Before you O Muhammad We sent Messengers to their people, some of whom We mentioned and narrated to you their stories and some we did not relate to you their account, nor was it ever in the power of any Messenger to display an act of a miraculous nature but through Allah's instrumentality and authorization. And when His command comes to pass, here or Hereafter. judgement is conducted in equity and justice. There and then shall the loss fall on those given to intentional assertion of what is false"
