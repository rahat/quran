    "text": "And when their Messengers brought them the clear and plain revelations guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment, they rejected the good counsel. They favoured what enriched their bosoms of worldly knowledge which satisfied their desires and made them rejoice beyond a common joy.
