    "text": "And before Mussa, came Yusuf (Joseph) who was sent to you with clear evidence of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, but you remained in a state of uncertainty as to the truth and reality of what he presented to you. And when he died you claimed that never shall Allah send after him another Messenger; thus does Allah neglect him who is extravagant in his account of himself, who is doubtful of the truth and He leaves him to wander from His path of righteousness"
