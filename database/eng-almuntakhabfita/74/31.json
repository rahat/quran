    "text": "(We assigned to no one but the angels the guardianship of the Fire and We stated their number a) to try those infidels' unsatisfied desire, b) to assure Ahl AL-Kitab, of the Divine Nature of Muhammad's mission, c) to give the faithful reason to consume their wisdom in confidence, d) to give neither party Ahl AL-Kitab and the faithful- an occasion to doubt, e) and to induce the hypocrites, the ill-disposed whose seats of intellect melt away in disease and lassitude as well as the infidels to speak out; and indeed they did. They said: What has Allah meant when He mentioned the Angels' number and what does He mean to fulfill?.Thus does Allah mislead whom He pleases and guides whom He will. and no one knows the number of your Creator's forces but He, and the description portraying « Saqar » is only a reminder to mankind"
