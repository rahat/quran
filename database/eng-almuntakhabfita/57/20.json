    "text": "You -people- had better know that life here is hut an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement and a display of splendour, boastfulness and vainglory and treasuring of wealth and multiplication in progeny; all but regressing naturally to nothingness, like man who goes from childhood to youthfulness to maturity, then to wrinkles characteristic of age, then to weakness and infirmity, then he goes through the gates of death. A succession of events similar to a land that has been tilled and cultivated by those who care only for the material harvest and counsel deaf to spiritual harvest. Then it rained, and the crops grew delightfully well and to their hearts desire. Then suddenly the crops lost their bloom and natural colour, turned yellow then dried up, shriveled and decayed. Likewise, in the Hereafter there is a condign punishment, but also forgiveness and fulfillment of desire; and life here is but an animate existence affording pleasure deceiving those with foolish credulous ambition and vain employment of time"
