    "text": "Then they -the hypocrites- call out to those who are blessed and say to them: \"Had we not been together Here and Hereafter and together we attended assemblies of prayers and pilgrimage and together we fought\". Indeed we were together, say the virtuous \"but you counseled deaf and you closed your hearts' ears and your minds' eyes and did not keep back from the forbidden. You were illuded with the false hopes that gratifying your appetite was something instinctively felt to be right and fair, and with Satanic deceit you had forgotten calling Allah to mind"
