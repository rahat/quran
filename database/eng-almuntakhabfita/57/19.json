    "text": "And those whose breasts have been filled with reverential. awe and their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety on the ground of their sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger and the promotion Of their purpose, are they who are titled with the dignified rank of the \"pure\", the \"veracious\". Then come the pious who carried the banners of truth at odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of \"Martyrs\" through resisting to blood with their spiritual armour. Both of them are they who have been destined to enjoy such designations in the heavens realm There await them a meritorious reward and light emanating from Allah's countenance to glow in their faces and proceed ahead of them But those who denied Allah and refused to recognize His revelations are those who shall make their abode in hell"
