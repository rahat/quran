    "text": "This is the Day when the hypocrites, among the men and the women, will say to those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues: \"Would you look back in our direction, so that we avail ourselves of your light\". But they will be told: \"Go back to where we were granted light and pray for it\" only to find themselves separated from those who are blessed and shut out behind a barrier emitting mercy to those within and torment to those without"
