    "text": "And why should you not spend in the cause of Allah and you recoil back as though you fear you may be reduced to penury when you know that Allah is He who has the Absolute rightful claim to the heavens and the earth and the only heir to the heavens and the earth. Those of you who spent and strove in the cause of Allah before the conquest of Macca where the faithful were few and conditions unfavourable, are not like those who spent thereafter when the gates of Faith opened and most people came in Those who spent before the conquest are a step higher in the scale of dignity, rank and reward than those who spent thereafter, But both has Allah promised good will and efficacious grace, and Allah is Khabirun (well acquainted with all that you do)"
