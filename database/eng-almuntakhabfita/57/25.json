    "text": "We have previously and thus early sent Our Messengers with expounded revelations and elucidated signs and accorded them Books and authority to administer wisdom and induce the war of justice against injustice, so that people learn the conformity to the truth and the justness of perception to deal with facts and deny falsehood. And We provided the earth with iron to attain a purpose, as will as power and strength in war against tyranny and falsehood' and to be of service in effecting one's object to do what is needed in life. Allah shall know who among the men do intend to direct their minds and their thoughts to striving in His cause and to the support of His Messenger to attain Allah's purpose; Allah is indeed Qawiyun (Omnipotent) and Azizun"
