    "text": "One day, you shall see those whose hearts - reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues among the men and the women disposed to merriment, their faces glowing with light emanating from Allah's countenance and proceeding ahead of them. It illuminates the way for them when they contemplate the most difficult and inevitable crossing; carrying their books bearing their records in their right hands. There and then they will be complimented upon their happy event of winning their way to paradise beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and how befitting and how exulting is the triumph"
