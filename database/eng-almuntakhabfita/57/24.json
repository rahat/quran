    "text": "Those who are miserly, unwilling to give in benevolence or spend in divine service, and induce others to be mean and parsimonious, have in effect permitted the forbidden and commended it to others. And he who counsels deaf to the ordinances of Allah must realize that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (independent, Absolute) and AL-Hamid (Worthy of all praise)"
