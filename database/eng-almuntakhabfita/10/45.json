    "text": "On the Day He throngs them before Him for judgement, they shall bring back to the mind their life below appearing to them, then, as though it had lasted for no more than one hour of the time of daylight, and they shall recognize each other by the distinctive features, the appearance and the character. There and then shall the losers be those who denied Resurrection and the audience of Allah, who were misdirected in action and thought and had the wrong purpose and intention"
