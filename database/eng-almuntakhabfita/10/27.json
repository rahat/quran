    "text": "But those who have committed themselves to an evil line of conduct, the retribution for evil doing is evil of a like nature, in addition to the gloom and the mortification which shall overlay their faces. No one shall they find then to afford them protection against Allah's retributive punishment; their faces shall be coated with gloom; a painful distressing darkness they will have to assume, as if they were wearing a mask made by a mould of a pitch-dark night These are the Inmates of Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering"
