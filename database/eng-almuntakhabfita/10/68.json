    "text": "They -The infidels- insolently said: Allah has taken up a son; glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes; He is infinitely Independent and Absolute. To Him alone belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Do you people have proof or solid information or a valid indication to evidence your ugly and false allegation ! Do you relate to Allah what you do not know nor able to prove"
