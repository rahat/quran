    "text": "To Him shall be your return at the end of your life here below. His promise is absolutely true. He started creation and He continues to create and recreate, and on the Day of Resurrection all shall be created anew. Then He justly rewards those who recognized Him and obeyed Him, adored Him with appropriate acts and rites and vested their deeds with wisdom and, piety. He requites those infidels who denied Him with what is commensurate with their evil deeds. Their thirst shall be quenched with broiling water and their faculties of physical perception shall suffer torment by consequence of what their minds and souls had impelled them to do"
