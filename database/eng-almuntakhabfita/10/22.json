    "text": "It is He who enables you to travel by land and sea and when you are on board a ship and a gentle breeze arises and the sails catch it and cause the vessel to move through the water before the wind, people rejoice beyond a common joy*. But when the light wind changes to a brisk gale** and waves rise in billows tossing them in every direction and they think they are enclosed by danger on all sides and they are bereaved of hope, they invoke Allah with an unconscious common feeling of an intuitive cognition and belief in Him, reasoning high exclusively of Providence to the end that if He delivers them from this catastrophe they would be indeed thankful"
