    "text": "When man is touched or befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, he invokes us for relief, reclining on his side or sitting or standing, and when We deliver him from what was burdensome and exhaustive to the mind, he passes heedless of Allah as if he never invoked Him to relieve him from a misfortune that had befallen him. Thus are the extravagant in their accounts of themselves allured by false hopes springing eternal in their bosoms"
