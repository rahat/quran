    "text": "After He has rescued them from a sure disaster, they simply run riot and go unjustly beyond prudent and reasonable limits. O you people, who do not keep a promise nor honour a vow: You had better realize that your imprudence works against your own interest: The enjoyment in life here is evanescent and fleeting and suddenly and soon enough shall you be on your way back to us, and there and then We shall inform you of all that your minds and souls have impelled you to do"
