    "text": "We do know that you -the Messenger- have delivered the divine message, no matter whether you are engaged in the affairs of mankind or in the ordinary pursuits of life or in any other concern, and no matter how little, or how much you recite of the Quran, and no matter what you people do or undo or accomplish but We are witnesses thereof. We experience it by personal observation as you busy yourselves for good or ill. Nor is there anything in an atom's weight on earth or in heaven that escapes your Creator's knowledge nor lesser or larger in amount or degree but is recorded in a documentary book that furnishes evidence of facts and events"
