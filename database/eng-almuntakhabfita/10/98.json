    "text": "Wherefore Had any town conformed to Allah's will, inducing the people to piety profiting by it, but they did not, except the people of Yunus who no sooner did they conform to Allah's will than they were the recipients of His mercy. We cancelled their misfortunes which drew upon them worldly disgrace and shame and had greatly injured their name. And We granted them comfort and enjoyment and all that advantaged them of Allah's blessings in life, up to a predetermined point of time"
