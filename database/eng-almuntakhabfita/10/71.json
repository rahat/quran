    "text": "Narrate to them O Muhammad the story of Nuh (Noah); it might bring them to their senses. He said to his people: \"My people, if you feel that my abode among you and my constant reminding you of Allah's message and of your duty to Him are annoying you and exhausting your patience, in Allah I trust and no one can stop me from doing my duty to Him. Therefore, get together with your predominant partners whom you claim to have authority over you besides Allah and decide on a course of action not objectively doubtful and fulfill it against me and give me no respite"
