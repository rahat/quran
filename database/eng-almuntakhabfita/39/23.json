    "text": "In complete glory did Allah reveal the best discourse -the Quran, a Book conformable in its various parts, a Book that both illustrates and ennobles the subject and imparts cognition and belief which in act evoke a quiver of the skins of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah their Creator, then it accords peace of the soul and the mind conducing their hearts to their settled calmness and their skins to softness at the thought of Allah. This is the spirit of truth whereby Allah guides whom He will into all truth. And he whom Allah gives enough rope and leaves to deviate from sense and from the path of righteousness never will he find any one to guide him thereto"
