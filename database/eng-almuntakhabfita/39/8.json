    "text": "And when man is touched or befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity he invokes Allah, his Creator, turning to Him exclusively. And when He extends to Him His mercy and grace and delivers him from what is burdensome and exhaustive to the mind he forgets and passes heedless of Allah as though he never invoked Him for relief not long ago; he sets up to Him rivals and incorporates with Him other deities to mislead people from His path of righteousness. Say to them O Muhammad: \"Enjoy your infidelity for a while, the pleasure you derive from falsehood is short lived and rest assured that you shall be among those destined to the abode in Hell"
