    "text": "He is it Who brought you all into being from one single soul -Adam-and from him did He, by special creation, evolve his mate Eve* And He supplied you with eight heads of cattle -males and females- (sheep, goats, oxen and camels). He forms you in the wombs within your mothers bellies varying your constitution in stages of development one stage after another (from rudimentary to complete state) in the depth of darkness environed by three superimposed dark compartments This is Allah your Creator, Who has the rightful claim to the sovereign authority, there is no Ilah but Him and so how could you reject Him in favour of other objects of worship"
