    "text": "And they* have not credited Allah with the attributes asserted as His own and they fail to ponder His marvels crediting His Omnipotence. which they shall realize in Day of Judgement. The earth with all its contents shall be under His command and His control as though it were an object firmly grasped with the fist and the heavens folded in His right hand. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely beyond all those they incorporate with Him"
