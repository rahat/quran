    "text": "To Him is attributed the authority and control over the known and the unknown and the mysterious schemes and systems which hold and structure together in harmonic relations and all that exists in the heavens and on earth. And He has the keys serving to open up, disclose and explain the unknown, the mysterious and the obscure. And those who denied Allah's signs and revelations shall occasion the eternal damnation; these are they who shall suffer the heaviest losses"
