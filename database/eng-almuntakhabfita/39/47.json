    "text": "And if it so happens that the wrongful of actions were to own the worldly riches and the affluence treasured on earth and as much of the same, they shall be glad to offer it in Day of Judgement in expiation of their guilt and of the inseparable torment laid upon the damned. They shall be faced with what they never expected would happen but Allah has brought it all to light and they now realized that their hopes have been doomed to disappointment"
