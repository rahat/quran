Or if He means to extend to me His mercy and blessings, can they obstruct the flow of His mercy or be able to withhold it! Say to them: \"Enough is Allah for me, in Him do I find the answer to my purpose, my hopes and my needs, and in Him trust those who entrust to Him themselves and their affairs"
