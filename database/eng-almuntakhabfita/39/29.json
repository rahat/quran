    "text": "Allah cites an instance of a man -a slave- who serves many masters who are quarrelsome and unable to find the concord for their perpetual discord, consequently, he is perplexed and at a loss. And another slave who serves only one master and by consequence he has peace of mind and he knows what pleases and what displeases his master and proceeds accordingly. Do they compare! yet most people do not realize this fact"
