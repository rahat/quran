And when they have reached its gates they are swung open in Allah's Name, and there, shall the guards receive them with a reproach unto their infidelity, thus: \"Did you not -you infidels-\" say the angels, \"receive Messengers chosen from your midst to recite to you the divine revelations revealed by Allah, your Creator, and warn you of this Eventful Day of Judgement!\" \"Indeed they did\", say the infidels. \" \"But\", the angels say\", \"Allah's word proclaimed beforehand is now being realized\" the infidels were born to be the inmates of Hell"
