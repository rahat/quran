    "text": "Does he who spends a part of the night prostrating his reason to divine revelation and his body comely in worship and submission and his heart and mind in applying remembrance to Allah in standing, bewaring the Hereafter and hopeful of Allah's mercy and blessings compare with him who is heedless of it all!
