    "text": "He created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality. He causes the earth to describe its orbit round the sun and by consequence He causes the night to move round the day and the day to move round the night performing periodical revolution. And He rendered the sun and the moon subservient, each describing its own orbit for a predetermined point of time, He is indeed AL-Aziz and AL- Ghafur (the Forgiving)"
