    "text": "If you -people- deny Allah and/or display ingratitude and ungratefulness to Him instead of being thankful to Him for His favours then you must realize that He is Absolute and totally Independent of you. It does not please Him to see those whom He created in order to worship Him actually deny Him, disobey Him and display ingratitude. Conversely, it pleases Him if you are thankful and your deeds reflect your gratitude. And no sou1 bearing wrongs or not bears in any way the wrong of another and in the end shall all of you return to Him; there and then shall He inform you of all that you had done or left undone He is Alim?n (Omniscient) indeed of all private thoughts and feelings reposited in the bosoms"
