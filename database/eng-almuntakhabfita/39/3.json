    "text": "Is it not in conformity with what is natural, right and just that dedication of the heart of one's purpose should be solemnly and exclusively to serve Allah's purpose!

He shall judge between them in Day of Judgement on matters with which they were at variance. Indeed, Allah does not guide the one who gives himself up to lying and whose heart is barren of truth and gratitude"
