    "text": "Above them shall there be layers of flames of fire hanging over them like a canopy of perpetual clouds of fire and no less shall there be underneath them. This is a picture Allah uses to caution those who worship Him, as well as those who do not, against the inevitable and He exhorts them, thus: \"O you people who should seek unto Me, keep in awe of Me and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me"
