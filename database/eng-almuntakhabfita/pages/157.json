But when such overwhelming events present themselves shall those who had disregarded the promise and willfully neglected it say: \" Indeed; now we do realize that the Messengers of Allah had brought us the truth which dawned on us with illumination and enlightenment\". \"Are there intercessors to intercede for us or can we be permitted to go back to life below to decide more wisely, think better than what our minds and souls had impelled us to do! \" Indeed they have lost their own souls and have been forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature, who failed their expectation"

He causes the day to lose its identity and its character by absorption into the night; both revolving swiftly in pursuit of each other and one dies into the other**. And the sun, the moon and the stars, He has governed by His cosmic laws and reduced to a state of subservience by His command. Indeed to Him belongs the creation of the whole and of all in all. Praise be to Allah, Creator of the universe and extolled are His glorious attributes"

Similarly do We resurrect the dead; an action consequent on Allah's will and it is hoped people will ponder"
