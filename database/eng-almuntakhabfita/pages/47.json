            "text": "Those who have such a voracious appetite that they indifferently devour all they can gain from their practice of usury are both offensive and defensive with respect to mankind and they assume the demeanour of the mentally disturbed who offer themselves to al-Shaytan who debased them mentally and spiritually. That is because they allege, \"Just as trade is a means of livelihood, so is usury; it is commercial dealing.\" But just as Allah permitted legitimate trade and consented to industry, He utterly forbade usury. Therefore, he who bows his ears in receiving admonition from Allah, his Creator, and restrains and monitors his desires and actions, may keep the gain from the past and plead his causes and Allah mercifully decides upon them. But those who relapse into this evil practice shall be the inmates of Hell eternally"
