Among them are a people who lift to Allah their inward sight and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety, but many of them are wrongful of actions; evil indeed is what they do"

But the more Allah bestows on you O Muhammad of His bounty, the more do many of them err for infirmity of purpose and display their transgressive infirmities of themselves and sink deeper in infidelity under the vexations of their minds. Therefore, do not grieve over those who are infidels indeed"
