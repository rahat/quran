Be a firm adherent thereto, before the inevitable Day which no one can avert nor will it be revoked by Allah. This shall be the Day when they -these people and all people- shall be separated from each other and divided into aggregates of like persons"

They presented them with clear and plain revelations guiding out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment -but they counselled deaf and closed their hearts' ears-.

At the same time it was incumbent on Us to save and deliver to safety those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
