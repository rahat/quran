Therefore, disregard them and rely upon Allah, and enough is He to be your Tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you"

Had they referred it to the Messenger and, in his absence, to those in authority among them, it would have been in accordance with divine standard. The Messenger and/or those in authority would have intelligently examined the news and rationalized the matter and would have known the facts and placed them in their true bearings. Had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you, you people would have been attracted to AL-Shaytan and espoused the opinions of those with characteristics befitting him, except a few"
