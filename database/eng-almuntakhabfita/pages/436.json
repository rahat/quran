And you see the ships -the large sea-going vessels and the river- boats- ploughing through the waves and cleaving the surface thereof to help you accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge and answer thanks"

This is Allah, your Creator, Who has the sovereignty of the universe and its supreme controlling power, whereas those you invoke besides Him do not own even as little as the integument of the smallest seed nor do they exercise over it the least control"

Your admonition and warning O Muhammad take effect with those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah albeit they do not apprehend Him by sight and they attend to religious Observances. And he who presents himself with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety will have successfully saved his own soul, and to Allah is the final and inevitable destination"
