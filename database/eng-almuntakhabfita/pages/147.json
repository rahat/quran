            "text": "Another strained point upon which the whole unreasoning turns is their superstitious belief of dedicating what they consider sacred to their males denying and condemning their females. Thus they dedicate what sheep and goats, camels and oxen carry in their wombs to their males and exclude their females; a concept bringing Us to eight copulatory mates. Four of them are a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Ask them O Muhammad: \"Is it the two males or the two females that Allah has forbidden or is it what both females carry in their wombs! \"Tell me who gave you this authority that you speak like a book if indeed you are declaring the truth"

Ask them: \"Is it the two males or the two females that Allah has forbidden or is it what the two females carry in their wombs! \"Or were you present as spectators and auditors at the execution of the alleged divine ordinance enjoined by Allah and you subscribe it in attestation thereof! \" Who then is more wicked indeed than he who viciously and wrongful relates to Allah falsehood and acts as a guide to people when his ignorance has reached up unto heaven! Indeed Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the vicious and wrongful of actions"

There is also the permitted animal slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than that of Allah. But under compelling circumstances and not in transgression shall Allah admit of relaxation; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"

This prohibition was imposed on them in requital of their vice and corruption. This is the truth We justly declare"
