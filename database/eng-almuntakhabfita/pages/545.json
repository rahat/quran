            "text": "You shall not find a people, true and solemn believers, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety and minds conscious of the Last Day, who would have intimate friendship with those who challenge Allah and His Messenger, albeit they be their fathers or sons, their brothers or relatives. These are people whose hearts has Allah inscribed with the justification of Faith as a conviction operative on their character and will; He has given them moral support, courage and just confidence. He shall welcome them to His heaven's realm and admit them into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, and in the beatitude of heaven they shall experience that vast forever. Allah has been pleased with them and they with Him. These are members of the Divine party; and who would heaven prosper better than the partisans of this party who are zealous supporters of the cause of Allah which is the heart of His purpose"

            "text": "It is He Who drove those who denied Him among Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book) out of their homes at the beginning of the thronging for the battle. You yourselves, O Muslims, did not think they would go out of their fortresses nor did they themselves think that their fortresses were penetrable to any hostile action, not to mention that contemptible notion of being proof against Allah. But Allah reduced them to impotence in His own manner which they never expected and He inspired terror in their hearts so that as they had tried to ruin the whole tower of Faith, they perfected their own ruin. They demolished their own homes and reduced their own property into a useless from by their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed you people of sight and can lift to Allah their inward sight"
