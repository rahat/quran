Allah has invested those who strove with their wealth and their lives in His cause with special distinctions a step higher in the scale of dignity and rank than that He invested in the stay-at-home. Yet both did Allah promise efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given. But those who strive shall Allah distinguish from the stay-at-home by quite a rich reward"

Therefore, be cautious; the infidels are indeed your avowed enemy"
