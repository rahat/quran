Allah is Wasi'un (Omnipresent) His grace abounds in the Universe, and 'Alimun"

And those on hand who wish to buy their freedom by performing certain paid-services deserve attention. You reduce a mutually binding agreement to writing if you believe that they qualify -stamped with virtues and sound minds- and give them -in benevolence and/or alms- something of the grace of Allah abounding in you. And do not force your female slaves -or any of your females- into prostitution for a worldly gain -a Pagan custom- nor make them recover their liberty by prostituting their honour if they seek chastity and purity. And he who forces them into sin shall suffer for it, whereas they -the women- shall, under the circumstances be recipients of Allah's Mercy and Forgiveness, for Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"

We quoted to you instances of punishment and We discoursed parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set fourth and We referred to the fate of some of those who existed before you, all serving as a deterrent and a warning for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah"

            "text": "Allah is the Fountain-Head of physical and spiritual light illuminating the heavens and the earth. His light is beyond all comparison, (to be perceived by the human mind), it may be likened to the radiance emitting from a lustrous recess where a lamp stands enclosed in a glass tube or encased in glass featuring extraordinary brilliance as if it were an extra ordinary bright star lit by spiritual invisible combustion from a blessed tree, an olive tree (an ancient emblem of peace) standing in the open, never lost to view. It is not confined to the east nor to the west. Its oil almost emits light although not touched by a flame. Majestic light superimposed upon splendorous light attendant upon a manifestation of Allah Who attracts to His spiritual light whom He will, and Allah discourses to people parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth, and He is 'Alimun of all things"
