They know well it is the truth and they make no doubt of its reality. Indeed those who contend with opposing argument against the predetermined Hour, denying that it shall come to pass, are transgressors who are lost in the very depth of the maze of error"

Had it not been for His word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite to a determined point of time, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now; but the wrongful of actions shall suffer a condign punishment"

This is indeed the great bounty and munificence of Providence"
