Do not reclaim them for a selfish end or spite them and he who acts in this manner will wrong himself. And do not mock Allah’s revelations and statutes, and render solemn acknowledgement of Allah’s divine favour conferred upon you and revere the Book He sent down to you and the knowledge and wisdom He imparted to you to caution you to commendable conduct, and revere Allah, and realise that Allah is 'Alimun of all"

            "text": "Mothers who have given birth shall suckle their babies for a period of two years if deemed necessary to complete the course of breast-feeding. It is incumbent on the child’s father, whether normally married or in the process of a divorce to provide both mother and infant with the means of subsistence and life’s necessities and provide them with clothing according to his means, in equity and honour. No soul is charged with spending except within the means. Nor should a mother or father suffer on account of their child. And in the case of the father’s death, the heir shall be charged with the same responsibility. If both parents wish to interrupt breast-feeding in the infant’s interest and decide to wean, they may do so. If it be deemed necessary to engage a wet nurse to breast-feed the child, you may do so on the condition that the mother or the wet nurse are not denied their due. revere Allah and realise that Allah is Bassirun, He sees all you do"
