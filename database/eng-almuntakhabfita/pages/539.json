It illuminates the way for them when they contemplate the most difficult and inevitable crossing; carrying their books bearing their records in their right hands. There and then they will be complimented upon their happy event of winning their way to paradise beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and how befitting and how exulting is the triumph"

Indeed we were together, say the virtuous \"but you counseled deaf and you closed your hearts' ears and your minds' eyes and did not keep back from the forbidden. You were illuded with the false hopes that gratifying your appetite was something instinctively felt to be right and fair, and with Satanic deceit you had forgotten calling Allah to mind"
