Say to them: \" Good enough for me is Allah as a witness of my actions and of your actions. He knows the truth of the Book -the Quran- and of every Book and so do those who apply their minds to the acquisition of learning and exercise thought and deliberation in reading the Book"

(Raa), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue cannot be emulated. A Book -the Quran- the Source of enlightenment - We have revealed it to you O Muhammad to guide people into all truth and to lead them, Allah willing, out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment, and to direct them to the path of righteousness, the path of Allah, the AL-Aziz (Almighty) and AL-Hamid (to Whom are extolled the glorious attributes)"

These and their like are indeed lost in the maze of error"
