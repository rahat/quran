Say to them O Muhammad: \"Do not offer defensive arguments; we will not believe you; Allah has informed us of your disposition and betrayed your attributes, and Allah and His Messenger shall watch over your innocence and follies, then you shall be sent back to Him Who is 'Alimun of the invisible and of what your bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and of the visible and the seen and of what is avowed openly and openly disclosed. There and then shall He inform you of what your minds and souls had impelled you to do"

Avoid them O Muhammad and have nothing to do with them. They are morally impure, unhallowed and defiled by sin. Their abode shall be Hell in requital of what their minds and souls have impelled them to do"

They look upon what they spend in His cause as offerings bringing them closer to Him and an inducement to His Messenger to invoke Allah's mercy and blessings on their behalf, for the invocatory prayer of the Messenger is indeed a great offering bringing them closer to Allah. He will admit their claim to His blessings and extend to them His mercy; Allah is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun"
