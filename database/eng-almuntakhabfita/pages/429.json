If We willed We could eclipse them in one swallow by a yawning earthly chasm We create beneath them or cause a piece of heaven to fall upon them in the form of discs of cumuli; either incident is by itself a great inducement for lifting to Allah the inward sight by the votary devoted to religious observances and to repentance with a breast filled with reverential awe"

We made a source of copper flow freely for him and of the Jinn those serving him by Allah's will, and he -of the Jinn- who defected or did not fulfill Allah's command came within the measure of Allah's wrath and We subjected him to the blazes"

Also to make for him images and statue and all kinds of pots and vessels of rounded form, broad and deep serving various purposes, some being large enough to be reservoirs and others as fixed huge copper vessels. And We said: \"Work righteousness O you the sons of Dawud and let your deeds reflect gratitude and gratefulness to Me\". But it is only a few of My servants who do this and impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness"

There and then did the Jinn realize that had they known the hidden and the unknown and realized the unseen they would not have remained in the slavish disposition scourged with humility and torture"
