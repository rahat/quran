He is the Principle Power by Whom events are unalterably predetermined\". \"If I indulged in prophecy and were able to foretell future events and realize the unseen I would have made all grace abound in me, and never would I have failed to be out of harm's way\". \"I am only a spectacle and a warning to people whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand"

And when he -the early man- approached her with amorous intention, she conceived and the pregnancy passed unnoticed in its early stages. But as the ovum became an embryo and the embryo developed into a foetus which grew larger and the mother grew heavier, the parents invoked the deity's mercy and blessings interpreting their thoughts in words \"If You \", they said, \"give us a healthy child free from abnormalities and malformations, we will most certainly be grateful"
