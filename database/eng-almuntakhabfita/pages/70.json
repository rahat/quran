            "text": "Thereafter did Allah replace the emotion of sorrow and grief by peace of mind and sense of security, which induced the eyes of some of you to take themselves to slumber. Others were aroused to emotion, which begot unjust suspicion of Allah, and a state of mind characteristic of ignorance - analogous to the ignorance induced by paganism. The latter keep their thoughts to themselves and do not express them to you O Muhammad and they say to themselves: \"If we had a say in the matter we would never have been slain here in battle!\" Say to them: \"Had you decided to be the stay- at- home, those of you predestined to be slain would have emerged to the sites of their interment.\" Such a train of events, Allah has ordained to expose your actions interpreting your thoughts, and to test your innermost being for such a disposition as your hearts and minds would incline you to propound. Allah is 'Alimun of all that is stored in the bosoms"

Who took advantage of their disobedience to the Prophet and led them to their fall from their first perfection. However Allah has afforded them forgiveness. He is Ghafurun (Indulgent), and Halimun (Forbearing)"

On every occasion when they lost some of their fellow countrymen in journeys of trade or in wars, they expressed their thoughts in words: \"Had they been with us and remained here, they would not have died nor been slain.\" This feeling and thought did Allah infuse into them to actuate their hearts and minds with grief. It is Allah who gives life and occasions the moment of death and He is 'Alimun of all that you do"

This outweighs all that you might have earned or accumulated had you been carried through the stealing steps of age into advanced life. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy"
