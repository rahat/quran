Indeed the cunning of AL-Shaytan is taken for a poor crooked wisdom"

They feared the enemy –to a degree comparable to the degree of fear due to Allah–Creator of all beings or even a degree higher, and they exclaimed against fighting; they said: \"O Allah, our Creator, why enjoin us to fight and implant our Hereafter in the now; if only You would put fighting in respite and grant us a postponement of this obligation to a future date!\" Say to them O Muhammad: \"The enjoyment experienced here below, no matter how long it lasts, is fleeting and evanescent whereas the Hereafter abounds in the best enjoyments and everlasting bliss for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, and no one is ever wronged not even to the equivalent of a single hair of the dry integument of the smallest seed"

Yet when good fortune falls in their way, they -your people– relate it to Allah, and if they are befallen with a misfortune they relate it to you O Muhammad. Say to them: \"All happenings, good or bad, are authorized by Allah.\" What ails these people that they hardly comprehend a discourse of reason"
