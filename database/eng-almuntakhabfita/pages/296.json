The aftermath of the event resolved itself in the manner that was inevitably expected. The people who by then had conformed to Allah's will â€“Christians- debated the number and the event and its significance, some concluding to construct a memorial on the site, others whose decision prevailed resolved to erect a house of worship thereon"

Others will say: \"Five, their dog the sixth\", an exercise of divination, whereas others will say: \"Seven, their dog the eighth\". Say to them O Muhammad: \"Allah, my Creator, knows best their number; it is only a few who have been given the knowledge of the number and the significance of the even\". Therefore, do not involve yourself O Muhammad in the heat of their dispute but treat the subject from an objective standpoint only so as to exhibit the actual facts and never seek counsel from any of them upon the event"
