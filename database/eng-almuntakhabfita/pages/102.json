But greater was their irreverence to Mussa (Moses) whom they asked to show them Allah personally so that they perceive Him by sight. There and then did heaven thunder against them and the fearful echoes thundered in their ears in consequence of their blasphemy against Allah. And worse was the reverence and veneration they paid to the calf which they worshipped and adored besides Allah. And this odd disposition, strangely ran in their heads after they had received enough signs to guide them out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment Yet We pardoned them and remitted the penalty of their serious offence and We conferred on Mussa delegated power and made him stand manifest of authority"
