Nothing material or immaterial is like unto Him; He is AL-Samiâ€™ (the Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and He is AL-Bassir (the vigilant who hears and sees all things)"

He gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He Will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will; He is indeed AL- Alim (the Omniscient) of all things"

And had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite to a determined point of time, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. And now your contemporaries, the successors who have inherited the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) are in perplexity about it on account of its present Intricate character"

Allah is our Creator and your Creator. We are accountable for our deeds and you are answerable for yours, no proposition does either of us advance to influence the mind of the other nor is there between us a contest of emulation; in one assembly shall Allah bring us together; He is the end and the purpose for which all of us are destined"
