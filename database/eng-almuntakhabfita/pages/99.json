What prejudice the minds are greed or cupidity and non-admission of a point claimed in argument or of conceding anything asked or required. But if you turn your thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall find that Allah has always been Khabirun of all that you do"

Therefore, do not disincline yourselves altogether from any of them acting upon your volition or upon a stronger volition than your own to keep her in suspense and mental anguish. And if you set estranged persons at one again and bring them back into concord and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall find that Allah has always been ever Ghafurun and Rahimun"
