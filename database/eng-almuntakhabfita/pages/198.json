They enjoyed all that afforded pleasure and was of sensuous character and they neglected all that was dutiful to Allah. Similarly you enjoy all that affords pleasure and is of sensuous character in the same way as those who preceded you; you plunged into worldly ambition the same as they plunged themselves into defaming religion and disobeying Allah. You and such persons are those whose hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter, and all of you were born to be losers"

All of them received Messengers who brought them divine illumination and enlightenment. Never was Allah going to do them. injustice, but it was they who wronged themselves"

These shall Allah have mercy on them and bless their souls. Indeed Allah is Azizun, and Hakimun"
