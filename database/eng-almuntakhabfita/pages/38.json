When the determined period of waiting has expired, those of you of influence are absolved of their inclinations as long as they are equitably and honourably disposed, and Allah is Khabirun (Omniscient) of all you do"

Allah knows well that attraction to women is natural to you and that you think about them. But do not secretly propose to them during this determined period, but you may hold honourable conversation with them. Nor can you enter into a marriage contract until the determined period has been fulfilled. You ought to realise that Allah knows what is hidden in your innermost being, therefore, beware of Him and be cautious and realise that He is Ghafurun and Halimun (Indulgent and Forbearing)"

But in order to do equity and justice you shall compensate them for disappointing their expectations; the wealthy, according to his means and the restrained, within his means, an expression of good will affording pleasure. This is a duty incumbent on those whose deeds are wise and pious"

And to grant remission is nearer to piety. Do not forget to exercise good will among each other and to commit generosity, for the actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts. Allah is Bassirun, He sees all you do"
