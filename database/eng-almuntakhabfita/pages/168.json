Whenever they see a sign clearly indicating Allah's Authority, they take pride in setting it to nought, and when they see the path of righteousness, they simply avoid it, but when they see the path of wickedness, they joyfully follow it, this turn of mind accords well with their persistent denial of Our signs they have been oblivious of"

Did they not perceive that it was mute! Never did it speak to them nor would it guide them or determine the course of events! Yet they reverenced it and adored it with appropriate acts and rites, and were wrongful of actions"
