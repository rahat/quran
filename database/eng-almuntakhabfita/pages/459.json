He forms you in the wombs within your mothers bellies varying your constitution in stages of development one stage after another (from rudimentary to complete state) in the depth of darkness environed by three superimposed dark compartments This is Allah your Creator, Who has the rightful claim to the sovereign authority, there is no Ilah but Him and so how could you reject Him in favour of other objects of worship"

            "text": "If you -people- deny Allah and/or display ingratitude and ungratefulness to Him instead of being thankful to Him for His favours then you must realize that He is Absolute and totally Independent of you. It does not please Him to see those whom He created in order to worship Him actually deny Him, disobey Him and display ingratitude. Conversely, it pleases Him if you are thankful and your deeds reflect your gratitude. And no sou1 bearing wrongs or not bears in any way the wrong of another and in the end shall all of you return to Him; there and then shall He inform you of all that you had done or left undone He is Alim?n (Omniscient) indeed of all private thoughts and feelings reposited in the bosoms"

And when He extends to Him His mercy and grace and delivers him from what is burdensome and exhaustive to the mind he forgets and passes heedless of Allah as though he never invoked Him for relief not long ago; he sets up to Him rivals and incorporates with Him other deities to mislead people from His path of righteousness. Say to them O Muhammad: \"Enjoy your infidelity for a while, the pleasure you derive from falsehood is short lived and rest assured that you shall be among those destined to the abode in Hell"

Ask them O Muhammad: \"Do they compare, those who apply their minds' eyes and their hearts' ears to the acquisition of learning and by consequence they are well- informed and those who are ignorant of the facts! it is only those who exercise their intellect and lift to Allah their inward sight"
