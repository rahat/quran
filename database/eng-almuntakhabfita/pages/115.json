Should they come to you seeking your judgement on certain points in dispute or on two notions whether or not they can be reconciled, then you may accept to judge between them or you may decline if you prefer. If you decline, they shall not touch you and you shall be out of harm's way. But should you accept sitting in judgement, then judge between them in equity, for Allah likes those who recourse to general principles of justice"

We made it the standard of judgement and the canon law by which the Prophets, who conformed to Islam, would administer righteousness and justice between the Jews. And so would the rabbins and the canonists who were entrusted with it as the guide Book where Providence is the guide and were witnesses to its divinity. Therefore, do not fear the people but fear me. Nor should you exchange the truth of my revelations and of -the mission of My Messenger- for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. And remember that he, who does not judge matters according to the rules revealed by Allah, will have denied Allah. Such persons are indeed infidels"

And those who do not judge matters, according to the law revealed by Allah shall be wrongful of actions"
