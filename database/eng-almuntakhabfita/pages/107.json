            "text": "Forbidden unto you are carrion and blood, flesh of swine and flesh of the animal found strangled and the slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than Allah’s Name, flesh of an animal beaten to death and the one that died by a fall, the gored to death and the victim to a carnivore unless it be slaughtered in time, and the flesh of the animal sacrificed on the altars –idolism-. And you are forbidden to divide meat among you by divination and raffling by arrows, this is indeed impiety. This day have the infidels lost hope of alienating you from Allah’s purpose and divine principles, Therefore, do not fear them but fear Me. Today have I complemented for you your religion and made all grace abound in you. And I have chosen for you Islam as the acceptable system of faith and worship But he who is forced, by reason of hunger and want of lawful food, to eat of the forbidden, and not by willful transgression of Allah’s commandments nor does disobedience reside in the intention, shall find Allah Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)"

Say to them: Allah has rendered lawful what is worthy, good and wholesome, and the prey of the trained beasts of chase - animal or bird- trained to go in chase of the game you hunt as hounds are trained in the manner Allah has taught you; you may eat the flesh of the game they catch but under the invocation of Allah’s Name over it when you release the hound and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Allah is swift indeed in executing the law"

And it is lawful for you to marry the virtuous Muslim women and women among those who had been given the Book before you(Ahl Al-Kitab) who lift to Allah their inward sight when you have paid them their due dowers intending to live together in matrimony and not as illicit partners nor as concubines. And those who reject faith shall their hopes be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter where they shall be among the great losers"
