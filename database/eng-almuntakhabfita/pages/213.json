Its inimitability, guidance and precision betoken its divine nature and exclude all else besides Allah. It corroborates and authoritatively validates all the divine Books revealed before it in time and serves as an excellent interpretation expounding all the statutes and ordinances past and present revealed to all intelligent creatures and exacts obedience from the whole. It is undoubtedly a Revelation emphatically revealed by Allah, the Creator of the universe and of the world-to-come"
