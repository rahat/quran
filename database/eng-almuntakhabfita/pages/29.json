            "text": "It is lawful for you to approach your wives if you will at night when not fasting following sunset, between breakfast and dawn. As fitting garments, you are mutual sources of comfort. Allah knows your instinct, a source of self- deceit, and in His infinite mercy He gave up resentment toward you and pardoned your offence. Therefore, now you may feel free to approach them following the statutes ordained by Allah with pure hearts and minds, and you may eat and drink until you can distinguish between the black thread of night and the silver streak of dawn, and thenceforth you fast until darkness prevails at the close of daylight. refrain at all times from intimacy and emotions exciting your carnal desire While in retreat in the mosques exercising religious devotion. These are the limitations imposed by Allah, therefore, confine yourselves within them. Thus, Allah expresses His revelations to people with distinct apprehension of all involved, so that they may hopefully learn self-restraint in reverence dutiful to Him"

Say to them: \"It is one aspect of the varying appearances of the moon according to the extent of its luminosity indicating the point and passage of time in which the sequence of events take place in the material universe, and for estimating the point of time when AL-Hajj to Allah’s Sacred House is performed.\" You people must realize that it is not in conformity with conduct to the divine and moral law nor with righteous living that you irrationally enter the houses from the back doors, this is an irreligious notion*. It confers with divine and moral law to enter the houses from the front doors. And see that you lift to Allah your inward sight so that heaven may prosper you"
