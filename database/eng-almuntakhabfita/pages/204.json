They swear to you O Muhammad that they only mean good, but Allah knows well and bears witness that they are liars"

A Mosque built on piety, obedience to Allah and the intention of serving Allah's purpose from the first day merits visiting for the purpose of worship; it is the most appropriate and the most worthy place for the purpose. Therein are people who aspire to physical purity and the purity of their souls and their minds. And Allah likes those who are physically, morally and spiritually pure"

And Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the wrongful of actions"

They strive in His cause whether they gain victory or be martyrized in His cause. It is a solemn promise Allah has pledged in AL-Tawrah (the Torah), AL-Injil (the Gospel) and the Quran, and who can honour and fulfill his promise better than Allah. Therefore, you may rejoice O Muslims at the bargain you have made to your advantage; This is indeed triumph supreme"
