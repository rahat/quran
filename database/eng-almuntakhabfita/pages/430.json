They enjoyed fertile and productive land covered with carpets of greenery and orchards right and left; they were told: \"Eat of what Allah has provisioned you of sustenance and enjoy it, it is all replete with choice of all delight and be thankful to Him. Productive of incalculable good was the land and Gracious and Ghafurun, the Ilah, the Creator"

By consequence, We sent against them torrential rain causing destruction of their dam, built to confine the water and to regulate its flow, and We replaced their fertile land and their orchards with gardens of bitter fruit, shrubs of small tamarisk trees and a few of the Lotus trees and other trees carrying berry- like drupe"

In response to this request We made them the talk of the town existing then and of those towns existing thereafter. We tore them apart, while those who remained lived dispersed among the Bedouins in the desert and among other people else-where. This was an act making the patient who is thankful lift to Allah his inward sight"
