            "text": "The rites of the Hajj are observed during certain fixed, known months ending in the primary devotion of the first ten days of Zu AL-Hijja when Hajj to Ka’ba is made and chief rites are commonly observed. Therefore, he who takes upon himself to make Hajj, whether throughout the whole period or only at the end part of it, shall not engage in worldly matters until all religious devotional rites have been performed. No sexual congress, indecencies, nor wrangling are permitted during AL-Hajj, and whatever good deed you do shall come to Allah's knowledge. And fit out yourselves with what is necessary for the purpose, but the best provision indeed is piety, and revere Me, O you people of understanding"

Nonetheless, among people are those whose thoughts are set upon the mundane of this world; they invoke Allah to bestow upon them life’s comforts to satisfy their enjoyment and content, and consequently never shall such persons have a share in the Hereafter"
