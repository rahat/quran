Nor, even though they desire to harm you, can they get you into harm's way. Allah has revealed to you the Book -the Quran- to guide you and acquaint your heart with wisdom and He imparted to you the knowledge of what you at no time knew, and Allah's grace and blessings on you have been indeed abounding"
