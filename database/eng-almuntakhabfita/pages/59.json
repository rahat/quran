Then at the end of the day they repudiated it as if it were a second thought, expecting that those who are unsettled in allegiance or belief among you may hopefully reject it all"

Say to them, O Muhammad \"grace rests in the hands of Allah. He confers it on whom He will and Allah is Wasi’un(Omnipresent) and 'Alimun"

Also among them is he who if entrusted with one single dinar, would not return it unless you keep asking and he may eventually be pronounced a defaulter. This is by reason of their folly and want of sense that they interpret in words. \"We are not,\" they say, \"under any obligation to these illiterate faithless people -the Muslims-\" and they intentionally relate to Allah falsehood which they admit into their minds"
