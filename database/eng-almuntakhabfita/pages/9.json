We said to you: \"Make entry into this town â€“AL-Quds- and eat as you will, wherever you will; it is all replete with choice of all delights and enjoy all that is wholesome and affords pleasure. Humble yourselves and bow your knees to Me as you go through the gate and let your bosoms surge forth and answer thanks. Express your thoughts in words invoking Me to relieve your hearts and unload your burden of sins. We will forgive your iniquities and reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety"

There and then were they stamped with humiliation and misery and came within the measure of Allah's wrath. This was in the train of their denial of Allah's revelations and signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority and of bringing death unjustifiably upon the Prophets of their own nation. Such vices were a sequel to the disobedience natural to them that it drew after it their addiction to transgression"
