Therefore, it is neither according to your desires O Muslims nor is it according to the desires of Ahl AL-Kitab (Jews and Christians) that Allah proceeds. He who commits himself to an evil line of conduct shall be punished for it and suffer for his offence; he shall not find besides Allah a tutelary guardian nor can anyone afford him help"

Say to them: \"Allah's decretal reply to your question, relative to women, is formally announced,\" “Instructions have been recited to you from the Book -the Quran–\". Further instructions concern the female orphans to whom you deny their due and whom you wish to marry: \"It is not right to take advantage of their helpless position nor of the helpless position of all those who are young.\" \"And you must deal justly with orphans and exercise your authority in maintenance of their right. And whatever deed you imprint with wisdom and piety is an honourable deed, it always comes to Allah’s knowledge"
