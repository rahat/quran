            "text": "And dismiss O Muhammad from your thoughts those who do not justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will and treat it mockingly and amuse themselves with its principles pinning it ostentatiously to their sleeves. They are deceived by the sensuous enjoyment they regarded as the chief object of life. But put them in mind of the truth, it may hopefully bring them to their senses and they come to realize that every soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and shall have no tutelary protector besides Allah. Nor shall humble intercession be accepted from any on behalf of another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of the one or the other. These persons of common attributes, qualities and actions shall be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds. Their uneasy and painful sensation of thirst shall only be quenched with boiling water and they shall suffer the torment laid on the damned who grew daily more and more wicked, intentionally denying the truth and asserting falsehood"

Say to them; \"it is, only the course steered by Allah that leads to the path of righteousness where Providence is the guide and we Muslims have been commanded to conform our will to Allahâ€™s will"

The instant He says to an object or to an event \"Be\" it is there. His Word is the truth personified and to Him belong the absolute sovereignty and the full control of the Eventful Event when the trumpet is sounded indicative of Resurrection and Judgement. He is the Omniscient of the invisible, the hidden and the unseen, the Omniscient of what the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of what they forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what you converse secretly and utter below your breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed, with all that is uttered loudly and with all that is being said. He is Al Hakim (he Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations) and AL-Khabir (The Omniscient)"
