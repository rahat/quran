They were met with the same negative response and were accused of want of conformity to the truth. And to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter"

Allah misguides indeed whom He will and guides to His path of righteousness whom He will. Therefore, do not let yourself O Muhammad be affected with grief and deep sorrow for their irreverent response to the divine message nor should you lament their deviation from sense with sighing Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient indeed of all that they do)"
