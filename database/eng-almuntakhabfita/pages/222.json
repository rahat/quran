He also knows the site of its future interment and when it shall be reclaimed for Judgement Hereafter. All such events are recorded in a Book manifest of precision"

Yet when you O Muhammad say to them that they shall rise again at the Last Day after they had been dead and buried, the infidels shall say: \" This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him"

You think that by so doing, Allah's message of truth would be accepted more readily and the infidels shall not use the usual formula of insolence and say: \"If only a treasure were sent down to him from heaven or an angel to companion him, we may be induced to recognize his mission\". You must realize that you are only a spectacle and a warning, and Allah is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all"
