For indeed, your Allah is One and only. Therefore, conform your will to His will -in Islam-. Meanwhile, announce O Muhammad joyful tidings to those"

You may eat therefrom and feed him who is content and satisfied in mind despite poverty, as well as him who is needy and circumstances compel him to beg. Thus did We make them -these animals- subservient for you that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness"
