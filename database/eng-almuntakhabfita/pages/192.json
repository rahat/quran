But Allah is not moved by undue influence; He continues to make His way unrestrained to send His illumination -the Quran- proceeding from Him, until the souls have been lit by divine truth, and enlightenment has prevailed, albeit this be hateful to those who refuse to acknowledge the truth"

It aligns the course of actions of thought and of life of all concerned, Muslims and Non- Muslims whose religious practices are contingent on man- made related aspects of the one religion whose unclouded and authoritative front is Islam; albeit this is hateful to those who incorporate with Allah other deities"

Those who treasure up gold and silver and do not spend of it in divine service were born to be losers; announce to them O Muhammad the anticipation of a grievous punishment"

There and then shall they be told: \"This is what you had treasured up and cherished; benevolence occasioned to you so much discontent that you denied the poor at their need. Now, you taste the torment which is laid on the damned in requital of hoarding up money and cheating the poor of their due and Allah of divine service"

Therefore, do not wrong yourselves during this period of time nor discredit yourselves by word or thought. And fight the idolaters in the whole as they fight you in the whole and do realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
