Indeed the system of faith and worship practiced by the infidels is simply worthless and leads them to the loss in the of error"

Ask them: \"Do you compare the one without the sense of sight or who lacks spiritual perception with the other who perceives objects by sight or perceives mentally and apprehends by thought ! \" \"Does darkness or want of spiritual or intellectual sight compare with light or spiritual enlightenment?\". Or did those whom they incorporate with Allah call into existence or form out of nothingness any creature, animate or inanimate, identical with any of those created by Allah, to the extent that they cannot tell the difference! Say to them: \"It is Allah Who is the Creator of the whole and of all in all; He is the One and only Ilah, the Supreme controlling and influencing power inherent in the whole and in all in all"

Where the torrent flows, it drives before it unworthy matter and impurities floating on the surface gathering into a heap of froth resembling aptly the foamy admixture and impurities mounting to the surface of the heated ores for the separation of precious metals used for ornaments and other uses. Thus does Allah give examples with allegorical representations of truth and falsehood. As to the froth and the scum, they are rejected and disappear, whereas what is profitable to the people remains behind on earth. Thus does Allah describe a subject under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resemblance"

If they have profuse affluence of all things on earth and twice as much, they would gladly give it in expiation of their guilt at Judgment, but far from it. These and their like must expect a manifest discomfort of body and mind. Much misery and hardship shall be the insignia of their reckoning when the account of their life and conduct is rendered at Judgment. Their abode is Hell and evil indeed is the bed they have made for themselves"
