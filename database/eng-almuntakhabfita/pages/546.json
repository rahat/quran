And whatever the Messenger commands you to do, you must do, and whatever he forbids you to do, you do not do,and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He punishes severely"

And he who opposes the incitement arising from the state of mind and feeling and guards himself against an unjust act, impiety, iniquity, greed, niggardliness, immorality and such vices, shall heaven prosper him and such persons"
