Had they- the unknown believers- been dissimilar in appearance We would have afflicted the infidels among them -the Meccans- with a condign punishment"

Allah takes the matters of fact He knows and you do not, and circumstances them in His own manner and He accorded you besides Hodaibyiah quite a near event"
