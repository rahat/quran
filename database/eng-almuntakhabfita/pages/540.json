            "text": "And those whose breasts have been filled with reverential. awe and their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety on the ground of their sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger and the promotion Of their purpose, are they who are titled with the dignified rank of the \"pure\", the \"veracious\". Then come the pious who carried the banners of truth at odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of \"Martyrs\" through resisting to blood with their spiritual armour. Both of them are they who have been destined to enjoy such designations in the heavens realm There await them a meritorious reward and light emanating from Allah's countenance to glow in their faces and proceed ahead of them But those who denied Allah and refused to recognize His revelations are those who shall make their abode in hell"

            "text": "You -people- had better know that life here is hut an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement and a display of splendour, boastfulness and vainglory and treasuring of wealth and multiplication in progeny; all but regressing naturally to nothingness, like man who goes from childhood to youthfulness to maturity, then to wrinkles characteristic of age, then to weakness and infirmity, then he goes through the gates of death. A succession of events similar to a land that has been tilled and cultivated by those who care only for the material harvest and counsel deaf to spiritual harvest. Then it rained, and the crops grew delightfully well and to their hearts desire. Then suddenly the crops lost their bloom and natural colour, turned yellow then dried up, shriveled and decayed. Likewise, in the Hereafter there is a condign punishment, but also forgiveness and fulfillment of desire; and life here is but an animate existence affording pleasure deceiving those with foolish credulous ambition and vain employment of time"

This is the sufficient and efficacious grace of Allah; He confers it on whom He will, and Allah is the Source of all grace"
