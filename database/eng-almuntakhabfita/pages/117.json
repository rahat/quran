And he who favours their tutelage shall be counted as one of them; Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness"

May Allah make victory sit on your helm O Muslims or take matters of fact and circumstance them after His own manner; there and then shall the hypocrites be really sorry and pained at heart for having succumbed to their evil thoughts"
