Their yield was hit by an icy cold wind that reduced it to ruin. It was not Allah Who did them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves"

They eagerly wish to overthrow you or bring an irretrievable disaster upon you. Nature has written a letter of discredit upon their faces that reflect hatred; such a hatred that is portrayed in their thoughts which they express in words, but worse is what their bosoms conceal. We have made to you Our revelations clear and plain if only you have soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends"

You give credence to all the Books which Allah has revealed while they do not. When they come face to face with you they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s blessed will but when they are apart from you, they bite their lips and their finger tips in the rage of distemper. Say to them O Muhammad: \"Perish those whose minds are backwards and perish you in the rage of your distemper; Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all private thoughts and feelings in the breast"

If you are befallen with a disaster or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy. If you be patient and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall not be hurt by their wicked plots and intrigues. Allah besets them on all sides and He is 'Alimun of all that they do"
