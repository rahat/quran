If they are carrying your seed in their wombs, you must support their state in life by expenditure until they are disburdened of what they carry in their wombs. If they suckle and nurse your child at the breast, then you must pay them for the service rendered, and counsel together in each other's regard crowned with equity. If you should encounter difficulties, financial or organic, then the child may be nursed at the breast of another"
