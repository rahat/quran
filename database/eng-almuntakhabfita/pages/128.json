He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that you converse secretly or whisper under your breath and of what you suggest, secretly to the mind, of all that your breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of all that you utter. Furthermore, He is 'Alimun of all that you earn of qualities, actions and deeds"

We poured down upon them rain and blessings bringing them into a people of condition and We made the rivers run beneath their settled habitations. But in consequence of their ingratitude and inordinate self -esteem, We destroyed them in requital of their transgression of the divine law, their offences against Allah and their violation of the religious and moral principles. We replaced them by other people who listened to reason and whose prudence got the better of their pride"
