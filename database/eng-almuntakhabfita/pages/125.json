They say: \"We are quite satisfied with the particular system of faith and worship our fathers were bent on. But how will it be if their fathers had lacked the soundness of judgement and had missed the path of righteousness"

You are all destined to go back to Allah Who shall inform you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do"

Two of your just men known to recourse to justice are summoned to witness the action. And in the event of being on a journey when the calamity of death befalls you, then two other men are duly detained following the funerary prayer to establish the point in question. And if you should apprehend guilt or fault on their part, then they are asked to perform the act of worship and then be sworn, thus: \"We swear by Allah that we have no selfish motive principles nor do we favour anyone for a gain, even if he be within the first degree of consanguinity, nor will we hide or suppress testimony a divine duty, and be wrongful of actions"

Therefore, keep you people Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him; Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness those who are given to evil"
