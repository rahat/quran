Never shall the wrongful find one instance of physical or spiritual prosperity Hereafter"

Had Allah willed they would not have indulged in such an evil practice. Therefore let them O Muhammad sink under the vexations of their thoughtless minds and befool the minds and the judgement of the people so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true"
