He who does not use the standard of judgement as revealed by Allah, shall be wrongful of actions, and such persons are the wicked"

Therefore, base your Judgments Muhammad on its precepts revealed by Allah, and do not follow their desires which deviate from the truth imparted to you. In fact, for each of you people Jews, Christians and Muslims have We authoritatively determined a law and a course to follow, and had Allah willed, He would have made all of you one conjoint body united in feeling and thought. But He meant to test your qualities with what He has ordained for-you. Therefore, contend you people for good will and for deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety; you are all destined to go back to Allah, and there and then shall He inform you of the detailed particulars of all the points upon which the whole unreasoning turned"

And do not act upon their desires and beware of them lest they seduce you into a course of action not totally divine. And should they turn a deaf ear, then you must realize that Allah has purposed to requite them in return for some of their iniquities; and many of the people are indeed wicked"
