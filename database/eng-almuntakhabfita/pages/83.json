Nor shall you kill each other or commit self-murder; Allah is ever Rahimun to you"

Men have a rightful claim to be apportioned the proper share of what they have earned (by labour or inheritance), and women have a rightful claim to be apportioned the proper share of what they have earned (by labour or inheritance) therefore, do not express yearning in an emotional voice after the privileges of others, nor suggest it secretly to the mind, but long for the bounty of Providence and show that you have fulfilled the requirements for deserving what you prayed for; Allah is ever 'Alimun of all in all"

But you must dutifully honour the pledges you vowed in the past to others in good will (heir presumptive, a slave released from bondage or a Muslim immigrant, whose right to the apportioned share of the heritage must not be defeated by a nearer heir), and keep in mind that Allah is Shahidun (a witness to all things)"
