They expect to imprint on your minds that these are verses of the Quran, while in fact they are not. They relate them to Allah when in fact they are not Allahâ€™s words and they relate to Allah falsehood and they admit it into their minds"

Rather he would ask of them by virtue of right and authority to pay reverence and veneration to Allah, the Creator, and to adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and devotion. This is the logical sequence which Allah has imparted to them, the divine knowledge which they have imparted to people, the divine knowledge which they themselves have applied their minds to its acquisition"

So when there comes a Messenger with a Book that corroborates and authoritatively validates the Authentic Books you hold in possession, you shall faithfully recognize him, uphold him and help him accomplish his mission. Now do you all subscribe to this allegiance and shall you pledge yourselves before Me to keep the vow!\" They said: \"We pray the prayer and vow the vow.\" \"Then,\" Allah said, \"you bear witness to this obligation which you shall relate to your people, and here do I subscribe to be also a witness to this course of action"
