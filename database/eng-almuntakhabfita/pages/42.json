            "text": "We endowed such Prophets with privileges, some more than others. Among them was one spoken to by Allah, and He evaluated some a degree higher in rank. And We sent ‘Isa, son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, and We supported him giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit, Jibril. And had Allah willed, never would have their successors fought against each other, especially after receiving intellectual enlightenment and mental illumination. But they were at variance in a state of discord and enmity, some recognising Allah and obeying His statutes and others denying Him or rejecting His ordinances and decrees. And had Allah willed they would not have warred against each other, but Allah does and enacts what He will"

It is not congruous with His divine nature to slumber or sleep. To Him belong all in the heavens and on earth. Who is it Who can intercede on behalf of another in His August Presence but by the graceful proclamation of His permission? He knows His creatures’ experiences and the course of coming events which bridge their span and no one can comprehend anything of His knowledge nor can anything be known except as He will. His Throne, His knowledge and His dominance and command extend over the heavens and earth, whose preservation does not tire Him or worn out with fatigue, and He is above all and beyond all, He is the Unique, whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality"

Now the path of righteousness has been distinguished from the path of error and holiness distinguished from vindictiveness. Therefore, he who rejects false beliefs and turns his attention to Allah with a religious mind, will have firmly grasped the eternal, unchangeable and most secure handhold which shall never separate, nor shall it suffer a break, and Allah is Sami‘un and 'Alimun"
