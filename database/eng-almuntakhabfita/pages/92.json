Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has declined to guide to His path of righteousness! He whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness shall no one be able to guide thereto"

Therefore, do not make a friendly intimacy with them until they have emigrated as purposed by Allah and be resolved to fight in His cause. Should they turn a deaf ear, then beset them on all sides. and kill them wherever you find them and join none of them in intimacy nor lean upon any of them to afford you help"

Had Allah willed, He, would have instigated them against you, and then they would have waged war against you. Therefore, if they are disposed to let you alone, proceed no further and offer you peace, then leave them alone; Allah does not commit you to any line of action against them"

Since, you have no binding agreement with their people, then unless they let you alone and proceed no further, offer you peace and curb their hostile appetite and withhold their wrongful hands, then beset them on all sides, kill them wherever you find them or whenever you gain mastery over them; Allah gives you, against them, a free hand and a complete liberty of action"
