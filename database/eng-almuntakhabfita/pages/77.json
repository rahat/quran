And revere Allah Whom you invoke for aid and protection and to Whom you appeal in witness that a statement or the like is true, and revere the wombs. That bore you and regard them as having a divine and sacred character; Allah has always been Raqibun (Omnipresent), He has always kept a vigilant eye upon you"

If they are incapable, then exempt them from this responsibility but gently and with kindness. And the property shall serve as the source from which you sustain them and clothe them. And let your dissertation with them be a sweet discourse"

If you feel they are characterized by good sense and prudence, then hand over to them their property and you must not abuse it nor act with expedition of time and events to absorb it or devour it before they come of age. And he who is entrusted with the property must not impose a liability or charge a fee for the execution of his functions, but be virtuous should he be wealthy and opulent. But if he is poor, then he may remunerate himself with equity. And when you hand over the, property to them -the orphans- you must have others witness the transfer, and sufficient is Allah to be Hasibun (a Witness Who calls to account)"
