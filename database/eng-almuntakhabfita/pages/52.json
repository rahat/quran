Yet not until they had received the divine discourse and intellectual acquaintance of the truth did Ahl al-Kitab fall into dispute and become divided through mutual envy and ill intention. He who disregards Allah’s revelations and visible signs shall find that Allah is indeed swift in putting the law in execution"

So have those who fell into line with me.\" Say to them and to the illiterates: \"Are you now satisfied with what you heard and have your doubts been satisfied? If you are, then conform to Islam\". If they do, then they are on the path of righteousness, but should they turn a deaf ear and their hearts cannot hear the truth, you are only responsible for relating the message. Allah keeps a watchful eye upon His creation and upon the way people conduct themselves in life and He knows the attributes inherent in each and all"
