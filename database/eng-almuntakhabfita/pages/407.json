Then how could you relate to Allah partners of His created beings?. Thus do We expound Our revelations distinctly expressing all that they meant leaving nothing merely implied to those who exercise sound judgment and have the ability to perceive and adopt the best means for accomplishing an end"

This is the natural instinct and the innate propensity Allah has implanted in mankind and no change ever shall there be nor should there be. This right and commendable religion is the only system of faith and worship that leads directly to Allah, but most people fail to realize this fact"
