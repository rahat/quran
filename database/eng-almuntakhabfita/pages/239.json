The seats were propped up with cushions, the table was set with delightful food and table knives were put in place, one for each. When they were served with the course whereat they use the knives, she ordered him â€“Yusuf- to come into the room. When the women saw him they were overwhelmed with wonder and they marvelled at his exceptional good looks with profound admiration to the extent that they missed the fruit and wounded their hands. They exclaimed \" Allah forbid this is not a mortal; he is none other than a highly impressive, stately and distinguished angel"

We do see you a man of piety and we see in you virtue in its true signification"
