One is a slave, the property of his master, who is divested of freedom and personal rights, the other is the master in whom Our grace abounds; he is free to spend in divine service and/or in other services secretly and publicly. Can they produce or achieve something equal or possess a like degree in any aspect of life! Never. Therefore, how can Allah the Creator of all be equaled with any being! Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes, but most of them do not realize this fact"

Wherever he sends him to perform a work he utterly fails to accomplish the desired end. Does he compare width his master who is whole just and keeps on the path of righteousness"

No one keeps them equipoise but Him Who designed their construction and made it fit to the object in view. Is this not indeed emblematic of Almightiness and Omnipotence to which bow those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand"
