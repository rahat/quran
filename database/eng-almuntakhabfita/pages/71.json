He made you speak to them in the gentle voice of peace. Had you been unsparing in censure and reproof and harsh hearted, they would have broken the bonds of loyalty and would have broken away from you. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy and consult with them upon matters of great moment, matters on which you received no divine authoritative instructions. So when you have caused a discord to pass into a concord and resolved on a course of action, then in Allah you trust, for Allah likes those who put their trust in Him"

In Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust"
