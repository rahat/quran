Woe betide the hard-hearted who counsel deaf to exhortation and will not apply remembrance to Allah. These are they who are lost in the maze of error"

This is the spirit of truth whereby Allah guides whom He will into all truth. And he whom Allah gives enough rope and leaves to deviate from sense and from the path of righteousness never will he find any one to guide him thereto"
