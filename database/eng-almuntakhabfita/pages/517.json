            "text": "O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety. Avoid suspicion in many instances and the conjecture of the existence of something evil or wrong without proof; suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin. Nor play the spy upon each other or peer inquisitively and impertinently into the nature of other peoples' actions, nor traduce or slander one another by speaking evil or falsehood or speaking maliciously behind his or her back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother! Indeed you would shrink from it with horror. Therefore, keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah is indeed Tawabun (Relenting) and Rahimun (Merciful). Allah indicates to people that He weighs them not by their parentage, lineage, descent or rank in life, but by the image their hearts reflect"

The one among you whom Allah values most and is held precious in His esteem is he who keeps Allah in mind and acquaints his heart with wisdom, and regards Allah with breast filled with reverential awe. Allah is Alimun, and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things). A tribe named Banu Asad went to Madinab, where the Messenger had emigrated, seeking relief for their families by reason whereof a famine had ensued that year. They had conformed to Islam, but they thought at that stage that they had become absorbed in the Faith, which they were not. Consequently, Allah defines to them and to the people at large the stages they go through"

But not yet have your hearts been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. If you obey Allah and the voice and reason of His Messenger, Allah will not depreciate the reward of your good deeds; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
