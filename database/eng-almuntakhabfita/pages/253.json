Say to them: \"He is Allah, my Creator, there is no Ilah but He; in Him do I trust and to Him do I in lowliest plight repentant stand and unto Him do I set my thought"

Further, do those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand not realize that had Allah willed He could have guided mankind as a whole to His path of righteousness! Nonetheless, those whose hearts dare rise defiant against Allah -shall not cease to be bombarded with disaster hitting them directly in requital of their evil deeds or hits close enough to their homes -as a deterrent- until Allah's promised punishment comes to pass. Allah never fails to keep His promise"

The infidels mocked them and gave them a lick with the rough side of their tongues, and called them everything they could lay their tongues to. But despite their wickedness, I put their punishment in respite, then I cast them down from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin, and how unbearable was the retribution"

Yet they still incorporate with Allah other deities. Say to them: \"Name them; or do you inform Allah of objects on earth He has no knowledge of! the fact is that the infidels' intrigues and cunning allured them to brighter worlds and led them, under the vexations of their minds, to a path other than that of righteousness. And he whom Allah misguides shall find no one to guide him thereto"
