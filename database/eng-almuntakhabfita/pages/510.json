But if your hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and you entertain the profound reverend dutiful to Allah, He will pay you all you merit and He will not ask you to spend your wealth in His cause except to give zakat (alms); for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer and if he -the needy- be hungry, it is zakat that feeds him"

Some of you will show unwillingness, and he who is parsimonious and unwilling, will only deny himself the future security depending on how much he had advanced in life to be credited to his own account in heaven's realm. And remember that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (Independent and Absolute); He is the riches of the heavens and the earth and if you are as dependent on Him as indeed you are, then you are poor enough and if you people turn a deaf ear, He will replace you by other people who will not be the like"
