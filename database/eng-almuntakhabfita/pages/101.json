If Allah graces you with His tutelage and victory sits on your helm, they desire with expectation to share the credit and they interpret their thoughts in words; they say to you: \"Have we not been on your side!\" And if the infidels who deny Allah are befallen with good fortune they say to them: \"Did we not back you up and avert the disaster which would have befallen you at the hands of the Muslims?\" Allah shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement and never shall Allah advantage the cause of the infidels over that of the Muslims"

When they stand to perform their act of worship they are dispirited and despondent; they perform their prayer only to attract notice and win the admiration of people, while in truth they hardly remember Allah"
