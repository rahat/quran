            "text": "The example of those who spend their wealth in divine service acting upon inspiration and stronger volition than their own, is comparable to an orchard at a high elevation with rich subsoil. The orchard is exposed to torrential rain effecting a yield double its normal produce. And in the absence of torrential rain it catches the moisture of the early morning and the light showers drifting down the valley. And Allah is Alimun of all you do"

Thus, Allah explicates to you people His revelations and He makes His signs obvious to the senses that you may hopefully ponder"

And Allah is Independent, Ghaniyun; His grace abounds in the universe, Worthy of all Praise"
