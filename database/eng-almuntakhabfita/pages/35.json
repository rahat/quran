Indeed, a slave who believes in Allah is far better than an idolater even if adorned with qualities attracting your love; nor should you allow your women to join idolaters in wedlock before believing in Allah with spiritual faith; indeed, a slave who believes in Allah is far better than an idolater even if adorned with qualities attracting your love. These idolaters influence your actions and deeds and you will end in the Fire, whereas Allah graciously attracts you to settle in His Paradise, and enjoy His forgiveness. Allah explicates to people His revelations that they may hopefully open their minds’ eyes"

Say to them: \"It is an unwholesome phase in the woman's menstrual cycle fraught with systemic changes including personality alteration and a general decrease in resistance to disease. Therefore, leave women alone during menstruation and do not approach them until they are clear of it and have cleansed.

Allah likes those who in lowliest plight repentant stand and those who free themselves of physical, moral and spiritual defilement"
