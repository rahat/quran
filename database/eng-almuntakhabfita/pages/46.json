And whatever you spend in divine service reflects piety in your deeds and it is but an advantage to you, that is if what you spend is truly intended to fulfil your obligation to Allah and to satisfy your conscience and hearts. And whatever you spend in benevolence shall be reimbursed in your favour and you shall not be wronged"

They keep up appearances exhibiting to those unacquainted with them a happy expression and satisfaction because their modesty obstructs their tongues. You know them by their appearance speaking a different language; they do not solicit peoples’ ears for charity. And whatever you spend in divine service comes to Allah’s Knowledge"
