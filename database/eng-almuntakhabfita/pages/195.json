They deranged your ordinary pursuits of life O Muhammad as well as your divine course of action, hoping you would not prevail and firmly establish Allah's system of faith and worship. But great is truth and it did prevail, and there did Allah's word, as is always expected, assume the top, notwithstanding their opposition and their evil feeling"
