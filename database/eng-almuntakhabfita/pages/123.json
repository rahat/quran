The exact equivalent be it in kind or in value, shall be judged by two of your men known to recourse to general principles of justice. And the sacrifice will be an offering to the Ka’ba. Failing this then he may supply food to the indigent in the amount equivalent to the price determined. Or he may fulfill his obligation by fasting -from dawn to sunset for a day or more as determined by the judges so that he tastes the evil consequences of his guilt. Bygone shall be bygone; Allah forgives what is past. And he who falls back into the same wrong-doing shall be severely punished; Allah shall take just vengeance on him; Allah is Qadirun, He justly avenges His right"
