If indeed you do entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah then you must not be disposed in your discourse, to accommodate yourselves to the rest nor care to please so that you guard yourselves from being supposed by the one whose heart reflects the morbidity inherent in his innermost being. Show discernment in the guidance of your discourse* and let it reflect equity and justice"

And observe the act of worship and give Zaket (alms). for alms are but the vehicles of prayer and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends to protect you from enormity and its consequences and keep it away from you the Prophetic household and to rid you of and to cleanse you from moral and spiritual defilement"
