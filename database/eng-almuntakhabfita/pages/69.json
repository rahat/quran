Some were in favour of obeying the Prophet's command and maintaining their posts and the others against his command, running after booty, at a time when the Prophet was about to make the victory. Among you are those who are concerned only with the interests and pleasures of life below and its mundane things, and others whose main concern is Allah’s grace Hereafter. Then did Allah distract your minds and your attention and made you draw off from the battle field to test your true inclination and He afforded you forgiveness. Allah’s bounty abounds in those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"

There, did Allah requite you with grief, upon grief, for being balked of your booty and for fleeing in the face of danger, so that you would learn not to grieve for what you miss nor to despair for what befalls you. Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do"
