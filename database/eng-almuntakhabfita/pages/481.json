Indeed He who revived it shall bring the dead back to life. He is indeed Qadiron (Omnipotent.) over all things"

But then, is he who is cast into Hell fire better or he who comes back in Day of Judgment actuated with the feeling of security? You -infidels- just proceed as you have begun if you will; He is indeed Bassirun (Omnipresent Who sees all that you do)"

Say to them :. \" It -the Quran- is the spirit of truth guiding those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand into all truth. Its inherent heavenly power exerts a remedying effect on their minds to counteract doubt and redress uncertainties; whereas to those who deny it, and their heart's ears are deaf, it exerts a blinding effect on their intellectual and spiritual perception. These are they who seem to be called upon from afar as the earth's distant ends; they are also distant from Allah's blessed abode"

And had it not been for Allah's Word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment of your opponents O Muhammad in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. They are in perplexity about it -the Quran- with suspicions amongst their thoughts"
