            "text": "You must realize O Muslims that these treacherous Pagans place before themselves one thing to be attained, that is to divert your minds from righteousness and uprightness and suppress Allah's system of faith. Therefore, how could they honour their vow or treaty with Allah and with His Messenger; they only conclude with you a treaty as a stratagem to obtain an advantage. Yet you must honour your obligation to those of them with whom you concluded a treaty at the Sacrosanct Mosque. As long as they honour their part you will have to honour yours. Allah likes those who obey Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"

If they get an advantage over you and prevail against you they shall reduce you to a useless form disregarding totally the ties of kinship as well as their obligations. They put in words the sweet discourse which gratifies you while their hearts bode ill, and most of them are indeed wicked"
