Therefore, those who emigrated and were ousted from their homes and suffered in My cause and fought the war of belief against positive unbelief and have survived or been slain shall be entitled to a great reward. I will remit their deeds of an evil savour, I will welcome them in gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, a reward from Heaven, and in Allahâ€™s grace rest hope and mercy and the best reward"

They humble themselves to Allah and never do they exchange the truth and the established divine principles for the worthless vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. Allah shall reward such people with what is generously commensurate with their deeds of wisdom and piety. Allah is swift indeed in putting the law into execution"
