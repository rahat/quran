            "text": "Meanwhile, announces O Muhammad, blissful tidings to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and there deeds wisdom and pious: that they shall be welcomed into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow. As often as they are offered any kind of the fruit therein, they express their thoughts in words: \"But this is what we had before in life for our livelihood.\" In effect, they are offered what bears a marked resemblance to what they had in life, but not of a like nature; it has the power to excite relish and ecstatic delight unexperienced before. And therein shall they be accompanied by mates of their design: pure, chaste and holy fellows of their piety and therein they will have passed through nature to Eternity"

            "text": "Allah is by no means reluctant from fear of shame to give an allegory applying creatures as small as a gnat or a larger creature to describe subjects under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resemblance intended to convey a useful lesson by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth. As to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, they know well that the simile narrated by Allah, their Creator, is the truth personified as it illustrates and ennobles the subject. But those who deny Allah wonder to hear Allah talk after this manner and they say: \"What does Allah mean by such a parable?\" In effect, such parables as Allah discourses are intended to stray the many who counsel deaf to the truth and to guide the many who have clean hearts to the path of righteousness and He misguides only the wicked who confirm themselves in the evil purpose and the ill intention"
