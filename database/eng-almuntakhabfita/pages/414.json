And when He saves them and delivers them to safety, then only some of them do keep their promise and begin to adopt an honest and godly course of life and eventually lift to Him their inward sight. And no one denies Our divine signs and favours ignoring Our revelations but the one who professes friendship in order to betray, mislead, deceive or seduce others and disappoint their hopes and expectations and impels himself to the feeling of ingratitude and ungratefulness"

Therefore, do not let life below deceive you and entangle you with the fleshy passions and mundane vanity nor should anything power, business, wealth, knowledge, long life, status, lust, or AL-Shytan or those with characteristics befitting him ever alienate you from Allah"

He causes the condensed water vapour in the atmosphere to fall down in rain drops from the floor of the vault of heaven as He will. He knows what is in the wombs of humans and animals, of the earth, of the depth of the night, of fortune and of any hidden cavity. No soul knows what it will earn; material or immaterial on the morrow and no soul knows where it is destined to come upon the encounter with death. Allah is indeed 'Alimun and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things.) see Introduction"
