            "text": "They -your people- seek counsel from you O Muhammad concerning the deceased who is childless and fatherless. Say to them: \"Allah’s decretal reply to your question concerns the childless and fatherless is formally announced, thus: If a man dies and he has no child nor a father but he has a sister, then she has the rightful claim to one half of what he has left.\" And should the reverse be the case then he inherits all her property if she has no child. And if the deceased in question has two sisters or more, then they go share and share alike in two thirds of what he left. And if they are a mixed company of men and women - brothers and sisters, then the general principle of inheritance applies; the male inherits the equivalent of what is apportioned to two females. Allah sets forth for you in detail the principles governing hereditary succession to property so that you do not go wrong, and Allah is 'Alimun of all in all"

            "text": "O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Keep to your word and fulfill the obligations to Allah and to one another an oath, a promise, a contract, an agreement, a duty, matrimony, conduct, an act and the like. Commandments expressed by Allah represent His will relative to the conduct of His intelligent creatures. Thus, Allah rendered lawful the flesh of camels, cows, sheep and the live animals reared for food excepting those designated forbidden. Nor are you permitted to chase wild animals or game while you are on pilgrimage -major or minor- nor in the environs of the Sacrosanct Mosque. Allah ordains what He will"

And when you have concluded the proceedings of Allah’s religious rites and divested yourselves of the pilgrim's garb and moved away from the environs of the Sacrosanct House, you may engage in the chase if you like. And let not your hatred of a people, once your enemies who malevolently obstructed your way to the Sacrosanct House, stir your emotions to retaliate. And unite in good will to effectuate moral virtue and piety and not in sin, transgression and impiety, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Who punishes severely"
