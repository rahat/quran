And no blossoms come out of their calyces as seeds or fruits, nor does a female - human or animal- conceive a seed in her womb or gives birth to - a child or an animal respectively - but come to His knowledge. And there shall come the Day when He - Allah- calls them up-the infidels - to bring into their minds those whom they incorporated with Him. There and then shall they say: \"We truly acknowledge, by way of reparations, our offence which we do regret and none of us can bear witness to a corporate deity"
