    "text": "He is it Who created the heavens and raised them with their spheres lying above or outside of each other inlaid with heavenly bodies superstructures kept aloft without pillars or visible means of support that you -people- can see.* He furnished the earth with firm stays, -mountains- placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, to stabilize** it lest it should sway you from side to side or in all directions. And He scattered over it animate beings of all sorts. And We send down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water instrumental in vegetal growth in pairs of like things emerging in varying colours with good qualities and of great advantages"
