    "text": "We imparted to Loqman* wisdom and the capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct and to the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends. And We exhorted him to impel himself to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness, for he whose bosom surge forth and answers thanks, serves his own soul. He who denies Allah's favours must realize that Allah is Ghaniyun (Absolute and Independent) and Hamidun (worthy of all praise)"
