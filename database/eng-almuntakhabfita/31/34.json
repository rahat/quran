    "text": "Allah keeps to Himself and in His hand rests the knowledge of the predetermined moment of the Final Hour. He causes the condensed water vapour in the atmosphere to fall down in rain drops from the floor of the vault of heaven as He will. He knows what is in the wombs of humans and animals, of the earth, of the depth of the night, of fortune and of any hidden cavity. No soul knows what it will earn; material or immaterial on the morrow and no soul knows where it is destined to come upon the encounter with death. Allah is indeed 'Alimun and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things.) see Introduction"
