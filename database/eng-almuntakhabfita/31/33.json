    "text": "O you people: \"Keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and regard with fear a Day when no father can avail his son nor be of advantage to him or be able to afford him help nor can a son avail his father or be of profit to him, and do realize that Allah's promise is Truth personified. Therefore, do not let life below deceive you and entangle you with the fleshy passions and mundane vanity nor should anything power, business, wealth, knowledge, long life, status, lust, or AL-Shytan or those with characteristics befitting him ever alienate you from Allah"
