    "text": "And when they-people at large-are overwhelmed at sea with waves rising in billows they invoke Allah for mercy and they invoke Him exclusively. And when He saves them and delivers them to safety, then only some of them do keep their promise and begin to adopt an honest and godly course of life and eventually lift to Him their inward sight. And no one denies Our divine signs and favours ignoring Our revelations but the one who professes friendship in order to betray, mislead, deceive or seduce others and disappoint their hopes and expectations and impels himself to the feeling of ingratitude and ungratefulness"
