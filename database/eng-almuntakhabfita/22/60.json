    "text": "And he who makes requital or retaliation on a person for an injury he has received shall -if he must- repay only in kind and in extent. Should he -the plaintiff- be offended further by the offender, then shall Allah help him -the former- against the aggressor -the latter- and give him victory over him; Allah is indeed ever 'Afuwun (Indulgent), and Ghafurun (Forgiving)"
