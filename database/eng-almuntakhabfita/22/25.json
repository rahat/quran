    "text": "Indeed, those infidels who rejected Allah and stood in the way to prevent His spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, malevolently obstructing the way to the Sacrosanct House shall have much to answer for We made it a refuge at the disposal of all men alike, retreating therein and exercising religious devotion as well as to the strangers.
