    "text": "Do you not see that Allah reduced for you al! that is on earth to a state of subservienacy, and the ships move on the surface of the sea by His invisible acting force producing their buoyance and their motion ! And tIe sustains and support the heavens -their contents- and keeps them from falling on the earth unless it be permitted by Him -meteorites, shooting stars, fire balls-. Indeed, Allah displays kindness to all people, -those who serve Him and those who do not. His mercy is extended to all"
