    "text": "Do you not see O you who are oblivious of Allah's Omnipotence that to Allah do all creatures in the heavens and on earth prostrate in adoration, praise and worship, and so do the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the animals and a great many among mankind! Moreover, a great many have deserved punishment. And he whom Allah defames or treats with contempt shall no one be able to restore his honour. Allah does what He will"
