    "text": "Nor did We send before you O Muhammad a Messenger or a Prophet but was opposed by those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan. They were determined to suppress their volition and intervene between them and their divine cause and to influence the peoples' minds with their satanic wickedness. But there and then does Allah annul the satanic desire and render it void and He confirms His spirit of truth guiding into all truth and strengthening His cause. Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun. (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)"
