    "text": "They -the Muslims- were unjustly ousted from their homes for no reason other than expressing their thoughts in words, thus: \"Our Allah is the Creator of the whole and of all in all\". And were it not that Allah represses some people by others, monasteries, churches, synagogues oratories and mosques, where He is much remembered and His glorious attributes extolled would have been demolished and reduced to a useless form. But Allah does indeed help those whose purpose is to serve Him and advance His cause; Allah is indeed Qadirun and Azizun (Almighty)"
