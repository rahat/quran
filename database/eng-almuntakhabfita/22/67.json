    "text": "To every people did We prescribe certain rites and articles of faith and the order of performing religious and other devotional services, and it was incumbent on them to follow (until the system was modified or replaced by a new system suitable for the time at the hands of another Messenger) Therefore, do not let them O Muhammad dispute with you upon the question, and keep proclaiming Allah's acceptable system of faith and worship. You are indeed on the right path, the path of righteousness, the path of Allah"
