They are almost ready to set upon with hostile action and words to injure and overthrow those who recite to them Our revelations, Say to them O Muhammad: -If these divine revelations are distasteful to you- shall I tell you of what shall be far worse and more distasteful to you ! it is Hell which Allah has promised to those infidels who denied Him, and how evil is the end for which they are destined"
