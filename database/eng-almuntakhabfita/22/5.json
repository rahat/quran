    "text": "O You people: if you are in doubt of Resurrection; nonetheless We raised you from dust, then We made you evolve from a seed* -a constituent part of emitted fluid- then from a clinging organism then from a bolus-like mass of coherent body of matter partly shaped and partly not yet shaped, to realize Allah's Omnipotence. And We embed in the wombs what we will for a determined period of time, We then disburden the wombs of you as a new born babe, then you grow to maturity. And among you is he who is caused to die and also he who is carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life that he loses the wits which were once about him and he loses remembrance of knowledge he formerly mastered; he becomes the abject heir of an illustrious name. And you see the earth lifeless and barren and when We send rain down upon and it is stirred to activity, it thrives and it is stirred to activity, flourishes and vegetates variegated vegetal growths of like things"
