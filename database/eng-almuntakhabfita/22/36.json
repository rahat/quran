    "text": "And the camels and cows did We make lawful for you to use in the event of your oblation of thanks giving and in your offering. They serve as a store from which you obtain advantages in plenty. Therefore, pronounce Allah's Name on them as they are lined up, slaughtered and laid on their sides. You may eat therefrom and feed him who is content and satisfied in mind despite poverty, as well as him who is needy and circumstances compel him to beg. Thus did We make them -these animals- subservient for you that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness"
