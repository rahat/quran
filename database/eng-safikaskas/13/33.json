    "text": "Is He who cares for every soul, according to what It deserves, [like any other?] And yet, they still associate partners to Him. Say, \"Name them. Do you presume to tell Him something that He does not already know about the earth, or is this an empty display of words?\" Rather, the unbelievers' ploy has been made to seem attractive to them, and so they have been diverted from the right path. Whomever God allows to stray, there will be no guide for him"
