    "text": "Even if there were a Qur'an which moved mountains or shattered the earth or the dead made to speak [they would not believe]. In fact God alone decides about all matters. Do the believers not know that, had God willed, He would have guided all human beings? As for the unbelievers-calamity will not cease to strike them for what they have done, nor [cease] to descend near their home[s], until the promise of God is fulfilled. God does not fail to keep His promise"
