One of them said: \"How long have you remained here?\" They said, \"We have been here a day or part of a day.\" They said, \"Your Lord knows best how long You have been here. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town and let him find the best food, and bring some back to you, but let him be cautious. And let no one be aware of you"
