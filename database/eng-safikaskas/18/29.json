Whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him deny the truth.\" We have prepared a fire for the unjust whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like molten brass, which scalds their faces. Terrible is that drink, and evil is that resting place"
