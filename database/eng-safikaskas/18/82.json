    "text": "As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys [living] in town, and there was a treasure beneath it belonging to them. Their father was a righteous man. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and then to unearth their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And I did not do [any of this] of my own accord. This is the interpretation of what you were not able to wait for patiently"
