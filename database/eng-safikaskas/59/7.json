    "text": "Whatever gains God has restored to His Messenger from the villages' inhabitants belongs to God, the Messenger, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, and to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate mainly between the wealthy among you. So accept whatever the Messenger gives you, and abstain from whatever he forbids you. And be mindful of God. God is severe in punishment"
