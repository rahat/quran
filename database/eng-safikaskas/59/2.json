    "text": "It is He who evicted those who broke faith among the people of the Book from their homes at the first mobilization. You did not think they would leave, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from God. But God came at them from where they least expected it, and He put panic into their hearts. They wrecked their homes with their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. Therefore, take a lesson, all of you with insight"
