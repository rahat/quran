    "text": "Allow the wives you are divorcing to reside where you reside, according to your means. Do not harass them in order to make things difficult for them. If they are pregnant, maintain them until they give birth. And if they nurse your infant, compensate them fairly. Maintain your relationship in a friendly and honorable way. But if you disagree, then let another woman nurse him"
