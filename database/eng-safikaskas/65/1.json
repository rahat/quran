    "text": "Prophet, when any of you intend to divorce wives, do so at the beginning of their prescribed waiting period. Calculate the period's term carefully and be mindful of God, your Lord. Do not drive them out of their homes, nor should they leave during that period, unless they have committed a proven adultery. These are the limits of God and whoever oversteps God's limits wrongs his own soul. You never know what new situation God may bring about"
