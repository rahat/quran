Righteous wives are truly devout, and they guard what God has ordained them to guard in their husbands' absence. If you have reason to fear ill-will from your wives, remind them of the teachings of God, then ignore them when you go to bed, then depart away from them. If they obey you, do not seek to harm them. God is most high and great"
