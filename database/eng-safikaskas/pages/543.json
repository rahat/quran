There is no secret conversation between three people, but He is their fourth; nor between five, but He is their sixth; nor between less than that, nor more, but He is with them wherever they are. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. God is All-knowing of everything"

They conspire to commit wrongdoing, aggression, and defiance of the Messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting that God never greeted you with. And they say to themselves, \"Why does not God punish us for what we say?\" Hell will be enough for them. They will burn there. What a miserable destiny"
