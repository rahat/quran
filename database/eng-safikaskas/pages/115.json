The prophets, who had submitted themselves to God, as well as the rabbis and the scholars, all judged according to that part of God's Book they were entrusted to preserve and to which they were witnesses. So do not fear people. Only fear Me. Do not barter my verses for a small profit. Those who do not judge according to what God has revealed are unbelievers"

However, If anyone forgoes this out of charity, it will serve as atonement for them. Those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are unjust"
