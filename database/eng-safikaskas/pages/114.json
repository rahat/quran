They distort the meaning of the words, taking them out of their context, saying, \"If you have already been given this [in your Scriptures], accept it, but if you have not, then be on your guard!\" Do not be saddened by them, for if God wills someone to be tempted by evil, you will not be able to do anything for them.These are the ones whose hearts God is not willing to cleanse. They will be disgraced in this world, and will have terrible suffering in the Hereafter"
