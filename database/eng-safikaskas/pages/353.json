Let them drape [a portion of] their head coverings over their breasts, and not reveal their charms except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their womenfolk, their slaves, or those male attendants having no sexual desire, or children who are not yet aware of women's private parts. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their charms. And believers-all of you-turn to God in repentance, that you may succeed"
