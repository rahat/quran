They said, \"Do we have a say about this matter?\" Say, \"The whole matter is God's.\" They hide their true feeling from you. They say, \"If we had a say about this we would not have been killed here.\" Say, \"If you were in your houses, those destined to be killed would have gone out to meet their death. God wants to test what is within you and purify what is in your hearts. God knows what is in the hearts"
