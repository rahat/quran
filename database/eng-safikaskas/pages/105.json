The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, is the Messenger of God; His word conveyed to Mary and a spirit from Him. Believe in God and His Messengers and do not say \"Three.\" Stop this for your own good. God is only one God. So exalted is He, in His glory, from having a son. Everything belongs to Him that is in the heavens and on earth. None is as worthy to trust as He"
