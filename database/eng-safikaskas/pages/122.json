So, the breaking of an oath must be atoned by feeding ten needy persons with the same food as you would want for your own family, or by clothing them, or by freeing a slave, and if a person cannot find the means to do this, he will fast for three days. This will be the atonement for your oaths whenever you have sworn [and broken them]. Be careful with your oaths. God makes His messages clear to you, so that you may be grateful"
