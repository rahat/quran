God knows that you used to betray yourselves, so He turned to you and forgave you. So now, have sex with them, and seek what God has ordained for you. [You may] eat and drink until you can distinguish a white thread from a black one in the dawn, then complete the fast until night. Do not have sex with them while you are secluded in the places of worship. These are God's boundaries. So don't go near them. This is how God shows people His messages so that they would be mindful of Him"
