Do not take them back in order to harm them or to treat them belligerently. Anyone who does that sins against himself. Do not mock God's revelations, but remember God's grace to you and what He revealed to you from the Book and the wisdom through which He exhorts you. Be mindful of God, and know that God knows everything"

Their provision and clothing are, in fairness, the father's responsibility. No soul should be burdened with more than it can possibly bear; neither should a mother be made to suffer because of her child, nor a father because of his child. An heir has similar duties. If both [parents] decide to separate, they will incur no sin. Nor will there be any blame if you decide to employ a wet nurse, provided you ensure the child's safety in a fair manner. But remain mindful of God, and know that God sees all that you do"
