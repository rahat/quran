Remind them with it, lest a soul be damned for what it has earned. It will have no one to protect it from God, and no one to intercede besides Him. Whatever ransom he may offer will not be accepted. Such people will be held accountable for their actions. For them will be a drink of boiling water, and painful punishment awaits them because of their persistence in denying the truth"
