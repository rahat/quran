God has written faith into the hearts of these people, and has strengthened them with His spirit. He will admit them to Gardens graced with flowing streams, where they will dwell forever. God is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. These are of the party of God. Unquestionably, the party of God will be the successful"
