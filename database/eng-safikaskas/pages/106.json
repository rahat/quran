If a man dies childless and has a sister, she will inherit one-half of what he has left, just as he will inherit from her if she dies childless. But if there are two sisters, then they are entitled to two-thirds of the inheritance between them, but if there are brothers and sisters, then the male is entitled to twice the share of the female.God makes this clear to you so that you do not go astray. God knows everything"

Once your pilgrimage is over, then you are free to hunt. Never let your hatred for the people who barred you from the Sacred Sanctuary lead you to break the law. Help one another to do what is right-- to always be mindful of God, and do not encourage one another in sin and hostility. Always be mindful of God, because His punishment is severe"
