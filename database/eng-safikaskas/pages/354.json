If any of those whom your right hands held in trust seek a contract then, draw one with them if you know there is goodness within them, and share with them the wealth that God has given you. Do not compel your girls against their will to prostitution, out of your desire for the short-term gains of this world, if they want to be married. If they however are compelled, God will be forgiving and merciful to them"

His light may be likened to [the light emanating from] a niche containing a lamp that is enclosed in glass, the glass [is shining] like a brilliant star fueled from a blessed tree, an olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west-its oil is nearly luminous even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. God guides to His enlightenment whoever wills [to be guided]. God presents such examples to people, since God [alone] has full knowledge of all things"
