They declare it lawful one year and unlawful the next, in order to correspond to the number of month made unlawful by God. They allow what God has forbidden. They are enticed by their own sins. God does not guide people who refuse to acknowledge the truth"

He made the unbelievers' word the lowest and God's word supreme. God is Almighty and All-Wise"
