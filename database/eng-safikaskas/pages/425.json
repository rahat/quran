That [behavior] troubles the Prophet, and he may be shy about [dismissing] you, but God is not shy about [telling you] the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition; that is purer for your hearts and theirs. You are not permitted to offend the Messenger of God or to marry his wives after him, ever; that would be a huge offense in God's site"
