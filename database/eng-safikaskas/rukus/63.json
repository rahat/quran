If there are more than two daughters, they should have two-thirds of what [their parents] leave behind. If there is only one daughter, she will have half. As for the parents [of the deceased], each of them will have one-sixth of what he leaves behind if the deceased leaves children. If the deceased has left no children and his parents are his [only] heirs, then his mother will have one-third; and if he has brothers and sisters, then his mother will have one-sixth. [This should take place] after the payment of any will or debts. As for your parents and your children, you do not know which of them most deserves to benefit from you. This is a law from God, and He is all-knowing, all wise"
