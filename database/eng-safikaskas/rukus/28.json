But turning people away from the path of God, denying Him, preventing access to the Sacred Sanctuary, and expelling its residents is a bigger offense to God because sedition is a bigger offense than murder. They will not stop fighting you as long as there is the possibility of turning you away from your faith. But if any of you denies the faith and dies in a state of unbelief, their deeds will come to nothing in this world and the Hereafter. They will be in Hell, where they will remain forever"
