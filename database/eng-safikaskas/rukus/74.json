If someone kills a believer by mistake, he must free one believing slave and pay compensation to the victim's relatives, unless they willingly forgo compensation. If the victim is a believer, but belonged to a community with which you are at war, then the compensation is only to free a believing slave; whereas, if the person killed belonged to a community with whom you have a treaty, then the compensation should be paid to his relatives in addition to freeing a believing slave. Anyone who does not have the means to do this must fast for two consecutive months. God ordains this atonement. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
