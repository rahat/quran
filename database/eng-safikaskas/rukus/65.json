However, if you have not consummated your marriage, you will incur no sin [by marrying their daughters]. You are forbidden to marry the wives of your begotten sons, two sisters simultaneously: with the exception of what previously took place. God is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all"

If you should mutually choose, after fulfilling this obligation, to do something else with the bridal-gift, you will not be blamed. God is All-Knowing and All-Wise"

God knows all about your faith; each one of you is part of the same human family. Marry them with their guardian's consent, and give them their rightful bridal-gifts. Make them married women, not adulterous fornicators or lovers. If they commit adultery when they are married, their punishment should be half that of free women. This permission is for those of you who fear they will sin. It is better for you to practice self-control. God is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
