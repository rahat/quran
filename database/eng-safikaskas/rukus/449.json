You see them kneeling and bowing down, seeking God's blessings and His approval. Their faces bear the mark of their prostrations. Such is their example in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is like a plant that sprouts, becoming strong, grows thick, and rises on its stem to the delight of the farmer. Through them God infuriates the unbelievers. God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those among them, who believe and do good deeds"
