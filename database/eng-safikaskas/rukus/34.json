Whoever drinks from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it is with me, except for those who scoop up a handful.\" All but a few drank from it. When he and the believers crossed it together, they said, \"We do not have any strength against Goliath and his troops today.\" Those who thought they were about to meet God said, \"How often small groups have defeated large groups by God's authority. God is with those who endure"
