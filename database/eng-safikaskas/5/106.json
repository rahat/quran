If death approaches you while you are travelling far from home, let two just men from among another people act as witnesses. Take hold of the two men after having prayed and, if you have any doubt in your mind, let each of them swear to God, \"We will not sell our word for any price, even if it were for the sake of a near relative. We will not hide God's testimony, or else We will be counted among the sinful"
