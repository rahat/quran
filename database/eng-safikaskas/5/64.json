    "text": "Those Jews said, \"God hands are tied!\" It is they whose hands are tied! They are cursed by God for what they have said. God's hands are open wide; He gives as He pleases. What has been sent down to you [Prophet] from your Lord is sure to make many of them even more stubborn in their arrogance and in their denial of the truth.We have incited enmity and hatred among the People of the Book until the Resurrection Day. Whenever they kindle the fires of war, God extinguishes them and they work hard at spreading corruption on earth. God does not love the corrupters"
