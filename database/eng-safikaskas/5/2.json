    "text": "Believers, do not violate the laws pertaining to God's sacraments, the sacred month of pilgrimage, or the offerings, and do not prevent those who are going to the Sacred House from seeking favor, pleasure and acceptance from their Lord. Once your pilgrimage is over, then you are free to hunt. Never let your hatred for the people who barred you from the Sacred Sanctuary lead you to break the law. Help one another to do what is right-- to always be mindful of God, and do not encourage one another in sin and hostility. Always be mindful of God, because His punishment is severe"
