    "text": "Those who say, \"God is the Messiah, the son of Mary,\" are defying the truth. Say, \"If it had been God's will, could anyone have prevented Him from destroying the Messiah, son of Mary, together with his mother and everyone else on earth?\" For God has control over the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wants and has power over all things"
