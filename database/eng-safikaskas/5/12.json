    "text": "God took a pledge from the Children of Israel. We appointed twelve of them as leaders. And God said, \"I am with you. If you are regular in prayer, give the purifying alms, and believe in My Messengers and support them, and lend God a good loan, I will cleanse you of your bad deeds and admit you into Gardens with flowing rivers. After this, any of you who deny the truth will be far from the right path"
