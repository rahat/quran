    "text": "Believers, when you are about to pray, wash your face, your hands and arms up to the elbows, and pass your wet hands lightly over your head and wash your feet up to the ankles. After sexual intercourse, purify yourselves. If you are ill, or are travelling, or have just relieved yourself, or have had intimate contact with a woman and cannot find water, then take some dust and use it to wipe your face and hands. God does not wish to place any burden on you, but wants to make you pure and to perfect His grace on you, so that you may be thankful"
