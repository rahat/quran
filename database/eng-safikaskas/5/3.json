    "text": "You are forbidden to eat animals that you find already dead, blood, pork's meat, any animal over which any name other than God's has been invoked, any animal that has been strangled or beaten to death or killed by a fall or gored to death or mauled by a wild animal, unless you can still properly slaughter it. You are also forbidden to eat anything that has been sacrificed to idols. You are forbidden to draw lots, since this is sinful conduct. The unbelievers have lost all hope of you ever forsaking your faith. Do not be afraid of them, but stand in awe of Me. Today I have perfected your faith for you and have shed My grace upon you and have chosen submission [Islam] to be your faith. As for him who is driven to what is forbidden by dire necessity, and not by an inclination to sin, God is All-Forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
