    "text": "[Prophet] We sent you the Book, setting forth the Truth, confirming what is available of earlier revelations and with final authority over them. Judge between them in accordance with what God has sent down. Do not follow their whims, which deviate from the Truth revealed to you.We have assigned to each of you a law and a way of life. If God had wanted, He could have made all of you a single community, but instead He is testing you by means of what He has revealed to you. So compete in doing what is good. You will all return to God, and He will clarify these matters about which you have differed"
