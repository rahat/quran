    "text": "Believers, if you ever abandon your faith, God will replace you with people He loves and who love Him, people who are meek toward the believers, uncompromising to the unbelievers; people who strive hard in God's cause, and do not fear being blamed by anyone. Such is God's grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. God has boundless grace and knowledge"
