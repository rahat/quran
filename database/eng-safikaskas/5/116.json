    "text": "God said, \"Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to people, 'Worship me and my mother as gods instead God'?\" [Jesus] answered, \"May You be exalted in Your limitless glory. It is not for me to say what I have no right to say. Had I said this, You would have known it. You know all that is within me, whereas I do not know what is in You. It is You alone who has full knowledge of unknown things"
