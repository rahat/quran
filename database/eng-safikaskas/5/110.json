How I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit so you could speak from your cradle, and as a grown man? [Remember] when I taught you the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel? [Remember] when, with My permission, you fashioned the shape of a bird out of clay, breathed into it, and it became, with My permission, a bird? [Remember] when, with My permission, you healed the blind person and the leper; when, by My permission, you brought the dead back to life? [Remember] when I kept the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with all the evidence of the truth, and when those of them who were bent on denying the truth said, \"This is clearly nothing but deception"
