    "text": "You will not find a people who believe in God and the Last Day, loyal to those who oppose God and His Messenger, even if they were their parents or their children, or their brothers or their close relatives. God has written faith into the hearts of these people, and has strengthened them with His spirit. He will admit them to Gardens graced with flowing streams, where they will dwell forever.
