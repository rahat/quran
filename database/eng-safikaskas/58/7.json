    "text": "Do not you realize that God knows everything in the heavens and on earth? There is no secret conversation between three people, but He is their fourth; nor between five, but He is their sixth; nor between less than that, nor more, but He is with them wherever they are. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. God is All-knowing of everything"
