    "text": "Have you not noticed that those who were prohibited from conspiring secretly, have returned to what they were prohibited from doing? They conspire to commit wrongdoing, aggression, and defiance of the Messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting that God never greeted you with. And they say to themselves, \"Why does not God punish us for what we say?\" Hell will be enough for them. They will burn there. What a miserable destiny"
