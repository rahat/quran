    "text": "It is they who denied the truth, and barred you from the Sacred House, and prevented the offering from reaching its destination. Were it not for some believing men and believing women, whom you did not know, you were about to hurt them, and become unknowingly guilty. Thus God admits into His mercy whomever He wills. Had the unbelievers been clearly distinguishable, We would have inflicted on them a painful punishment"
