    "text": "There is not any restriction on the blind, the lame, the ill or yourselves when you eat from your [own] houses or the houses of your fathers, your mothers, your brothers, your sisters, your father's brothers, your father's sisters, your mother's brothers, your mother's sisters or [from houses] whose keys you possess, or from any of your friends' houses. There is nothing wrong with your eating [either] together or separately, but, when you enter any house, give greetings of peace upon each other, a greeting from God, blessed and good. In this way God makes His messages clear to you so that you may understand"
