    "text": "God is the illuminator of the heavens and the earth. His light may be likened to [the light emanating from] a niche containing a lamp that is enclosed in glass, the glass [is shining] like a brilliant star fueled from a blessed tree, an olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west-its oil is nearly luminous even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. God guides to His enlightenment whoever wills [to be guided]. God presents such examples to people, since God [alone] has full knowledge of all things"
