    "text": "God has promised those among you who have believed and done righteous deeds that He will make them successors upon the earth just as He did those before them, and that He will establish for them the faith that He has chosen for them. He will exchange the fear they have experienced with security, [for] they worship Me [alone], not associating anything with Me. But whoever denies the truth after [having understood] this, then those are the defiantly disobedient"
