    "text": "Those who are unable to marry should keep chaste until God gives them sufficiently from His favor. If any of those whom your right hands held in trust seek a contract then, draw one with them if you know there is goodness within them, and share with them the wealth that God has given you. Do not compel your girls against their will to prostitution, out of your desire for the short-term gains of this world, if they want to be married. If they however are compelled, God will be forgiving and merciful to them"
