    "text": "Believers, let your slaves and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you ask permission of you [before entering your presence] at three times of the day: before the dawn prayer, and when you take off your clothing [for rest] at noon, and after the evening prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. At other times, there is no blame on you or them if you move about freely, tending to each other's needs. In this way does God make the message clear to you, for God is All-Knowing and All-Wise"
