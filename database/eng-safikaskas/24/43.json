    "text": "Do not you see that God drives the clouds, then brings them together, and then piles them into heaps until you see rain come pouring from them? He sends down from the sky mountains [of clouds] filled with hail, striking with it whom He wills and averting it from whom He wills. The flash of its lightening almost blinds the eyes"
