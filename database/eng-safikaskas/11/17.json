    "text": "Can they be compared to those who have clear evidence from their Lord, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him-as was the book previously revealed to Moses-to be a guide and mercy [to humanity]? Those [who understand] believe in it, whereas those parties that deny its truth are promised the fire.
