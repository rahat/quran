    "text": "Believers, no men shall ridicule others, for they may be better than them. Nor shall any women ridicule other women, for they may be better than them. Nor shall you slander one another, nor shall you call each other names. How bad it is to be called disobedient after accepting faith! Those who do not repent of this behavior are unjust"
