    "text": "We sent Our Messengers with clear evidence and We sent down with them the Book and the Balance, that people may establish justice. And We sent down iron, which can be used for military might and to benefit people in many different ways. So that God may know those who uplifted Him and His Messengers though He is beyond their senses. God is All-Powerful, Almighty"
