    "text": "Then We sent Our Messengers to follow in their footsteps and followed up with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. We placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. As for monasticism, which they invented to seek God's pleasure, We did not ordain for them, and they did not observe properly. So We gave those who believed among them their reward, but many of them are wicked"
