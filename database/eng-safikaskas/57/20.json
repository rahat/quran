    "text": "Know that the life of this world is just a game; recreation, glitter, boasting to one another and rivalry in wealth and children. It is like a rain that helps plants grow, pleasing the growers, but then it dries up and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes stubble. There is severe punishment in the Hereafter, as well as forgiveness from God and [His] approval. The life of this world is only an illusion"
