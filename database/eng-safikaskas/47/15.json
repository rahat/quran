    "text": "The example of the Paradise promised to those who are mindful of God is that of a place that has rivers of pure water, and rivers of milk forever fresh, and rivers of wine delightful to all who drink it, and rivers of strained honey. They will have in it all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Is this like those who will abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink boiling water that will cut through their bowels"
