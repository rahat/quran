    "text": "[God] says, \"Join the crowds of jinn and humans who have gone before you into the fire.\" Every time a crowd enters, it will curse its fellow beings, so that when they have all gathered inside, the last of them will say about the first, \"Lord, It is they who have led us astray. Give them double suffering through fire.\" He will reply, \"Every one of you deserves double suffering, though you don't know it"
