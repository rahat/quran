    "text": "Children of Adam, do not allow Satan to seduce you in the same way he caused your ancestors to be driven out of the Garden. He deprived them of their garment [of God-consciousness] in order to make them aware of their nakedness. He and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made satanic forces allies to those who do not believe"
