    "text": "They have been succeeded by generations who, [in spite of] having inherited the Book, hold onto the momentary treasures of this world [in preference to the Hereafter] and say, \"We will be forgiven\". Yet if the same opportunity comes around again they will take it. Didn't they make a commitment based on the Book, not to say anything about God that was not the Truth and [haven't they] studied its contents well? Since the life in the Hereafter is the better [of the two] for all who are mindful of God, will you not use your common sense"
