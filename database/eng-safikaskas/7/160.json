    "text": "We divided them into twelve tribes. When his people asked Moses for water, We inspired him, \"Strike the rock with your staff,\" and twelve springs gushed out so that all the people knew where to drink. We caused the clouds to comfort them with their shade, and We sent down to them manna and quail. We said, \"Eat the good things We have provided for you.\" They did no wrong to Us; they only wronged themselves"
