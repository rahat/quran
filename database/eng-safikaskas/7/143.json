    "text": "When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show [Yourself] to me, so that I might see You.\" [God] said, \"You can never see Me. However, behold this mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.\" As soon as his Lord revealed His limitless glory to the mountain, He caused it to crumble to dust and Moses fell down unconscious. After he recovered, he said, \"May You be exalted in Your glory! I repent! I will be the first of the believers"
