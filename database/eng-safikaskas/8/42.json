    "text": "You were near the end of the valley [of Badr] and they were at the far end, and the caravan was below you. Even if you had made a prior arrangement to meet there, you would have missed it, but [You have met] so that God might bring about a matter already decided. This was so that those who would die might die in clear sight of the Truth and that he who would remain alive might live in clear sight of the Truth. God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
