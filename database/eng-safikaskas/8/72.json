    "text": "Those who believed and who emigrated [to Medina] and struggled for God's cause with their possessions and lives, and those who have given refuge and help, are all allies of one another. As far as those who believed but did not emigrate, you do not owe them any protection until they have emigrated. If they are prevented from freely practicing their faith and ask you for help, you must help them, except against people with whom you have a treaty. God sees all that you do"
