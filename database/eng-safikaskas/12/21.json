    "text": "The man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, \"Look after him well. He may be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" In this way We gave Joseph a firm place on earth, and [We did this] so that We could teach him the inner meaning of things. God always prevails in His purpose, but most people do not know this"
