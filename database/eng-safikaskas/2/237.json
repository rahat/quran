    "text": "If you divorce them before you touch them, but after you have given them their dowry, then let them have half of it, unless they renounce [their claim], or unless the one making the marriage-tie renounces it. Renouncing [the portion] is closer to being mindful of God. Do not forget the grace that is between you. God sees what you do"
