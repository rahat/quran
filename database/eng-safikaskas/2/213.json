    "text": "Human beings were [once] all one nation. God sent prophets carrying good news and warnings, and with them He sent the Book in Truth to judge between people in matters on which they differ. Yet rivalry between those who received it led them to disagreement, even after having received clear signs. God willingly guided believers to the truth about which they differed. God guides whoever wants to be guided into a straight path"
