    "text": "We preferred some of those messengers over others. God spoke to some, and He raised some in degree; We gave Jesus son of Mary clear signs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, those after them would not have fought each other after clear evidence of the truth had come to them, but they fought. Some of them believed, and others denied the truth. If God had willed, they would not have fought. But God does whatever He wants"
