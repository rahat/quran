    "text": "Have you not considered the one who was given a kingship by God [and] then disputed with Abram about his Lord? Abram said, \"My Lord gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I also give life and death.\" Abram said, \"God brings the sun from the East. So bring it from the West.\" The disbeliever was dumfounded. God does not guide unjust people"
