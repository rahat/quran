He said, \"How can God bring back those who were once alive here after their death?\" God made him die for a hundred years, and then resurrected him. He said, \"How long have you stayed?\" He said, \"A day or part of a day.\" He said, \"You stayed for a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink. They have not gone bad. Look at your dead donkey. We will make you a sign for people. Look how We raise the bones, and then cover them with flesh.\" When he saw it, he said, \"I know that God has power over all things"
