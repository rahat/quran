    "text": "Divorced women will wait three menstruation periods [before re-marrying], for they are not allowed to hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their husbands are entitled to take them back if they want to be reconciled. But, in accordance with justice, the rights of the wives [with regard to their husbands] are equal to the [husbands'] rights with regard to them, although husbands have a degree [of right] over them. God is almighty and wise"
