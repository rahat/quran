    "text": "Mothers should nurse their children for two complete years if they wish to complete the nursing period. Their provision and clothing are, in fairness, the father's responsibility. No soul should be burdened with more than it can possibly bear; neither should a mother be made to suffer because of her child, nor a father because of his child. An heir has similar duties. If both [parents] decide to separate, they will incur no sin. Nor will there be any blame if you decide to employ a wet nurse, provided you ensure the child's safety in a fair manner. But remain mindful of God, and know that God sees all that you do"
