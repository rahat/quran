    "text": "Divorce is allowed twice, after which keep [your wives] kindly, or dismiss them generously. You [husbands] may not take back anything you have given them unless both of you fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits set by God. It is not then wrong for them if she buys her way out. These are God's limits, do not exceed them. Anyone who exceeds them is unjust"
