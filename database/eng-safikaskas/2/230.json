    "text": "If he divorces her [for the third time], she is no longer allowed to remarry him until she marries another husband. Then, if [the latter] divorces her, it is not wrong for them to return [to each other] if they think that they can observe God's limits. These are the bounds set by God, which He makes clear to people who have knowledge"
