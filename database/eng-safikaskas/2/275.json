    "text": "Those who profit from usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan's touch because they say, \"Selling is like usury, but God allowed selling and forbade usury.\" So whoever stops when receiving his Lord's good advice may keep what was previously his, and his matter is with God. Those who return to [usury] will eternally be in Hell"
