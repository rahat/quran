    "text": "It is not appropriate for the people of Medina and the Bedouins [who live] around them to stay behind [and refuse to follow] God's Messenger. Nor should they care about themselves more than they care for him. This is because a righteous deed is registered to their favor every time they suffer from thirst, weariness or hunger in God's cause, or take any step that angers the unbelievers, or cause any harm to any enemy. God never loses track of the rewards [due] those who do good"
