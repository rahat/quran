    "text": "The hypocrites swear by God that they have said nothing wrong, but they have definitely uttered words of blasphemy and become unbelievers after having submitted. They plotted that which was beyond their ability. They resented that God and His Messenger had enriched them out of His favor. If they repent, it would be for their own good, but if they turn away, God will cause them to suffer painfully in this world and in the life to come, and no one on earth will be able to help or protect them"
