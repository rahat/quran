    "text": "And [We subjected] the wind to Solomon; its morning course [covered] a month's journey, and its evening course [covered] a month's journey. And We made a fountain of molten copper flow for him. And among the jinn were those who worked for him with his Lord's permission, and whoever among them deviated from Our command, We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blazing flame"
