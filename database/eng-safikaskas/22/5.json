    "text": "People-If you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then [consider that] We created you from dust, then from a fertilized ovum, then a leach like, and then a chewed morsel, differentiated and undifferentiated so We may show you [our power]. And We settle in the womb what We wish for a specified term, then We bring you forth as an infant, and then you may grow to reach maturity. And among you some will die, and some will reach the most decrepit age in which he no longer knows what he once knew. You see the earth barren, yet when We send down rain, it shakes and swells and produces every kind of beautiful plant"
