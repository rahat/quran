    "text": "And strive for God as He deserves. He has chosen you and has not imposed hardships on you in religion- the faith of your father, Abraham. He named you \"Muslims\" [submitters] before [in former Books] and in this [revelation], so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and you may be witnesses over other human beings. So, perform prayer, and give the purifying alms and hold fast to God. He is your protector, and how excellent is this protector, how excellent this helper"
