    "text": "If you deny the truth, God has no need of you. Yet He does not approve of ingratitude in His servants, but, if you do show gratitude, He welcomes it in you. No bearer of burdens will bear the burdens of another. Then you will return to your Lord, and He will inform you of what you have done. He knows what is within your hearts"
