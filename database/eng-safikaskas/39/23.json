    "text": "God has sent down the best of narrations: a Book that is perfectly consistent within itself, repeating various statements [of the Truth] in forms that causes the skin of those who revere their Lord to shiver [in awe], after which their skin and their hearts soften at the mention of God. Such is God's guidance; He guides with it [the Qur'an] whoever is willing to be guided, but no one can guide those God leaves to stray"
