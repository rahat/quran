    "text": "We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and caused their number to be a stumbling block for those who disbelieve; so that those given the Book may attain certainty; and those who believe may increase in faith; and those given the Book and the believers may not doubt; and those in whose hearts is sickness and the unbelievers may say, \"What did God ever mean by this example?\" In this way God lets go astray the one who wishes to go astray, and guides him who wishes to be guided. None knows your Lord's forces but Him. This is nothing but a reminder to all human beings"
