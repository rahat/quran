    "text": "Among those of the Jewish faith, some distort the meaning of the [revealed] words, taking them out of their context and saying, \"We have heard, but we disobey,\" and, \"Listen,\" [adding the insult] 'May you not hear,' - thus speaking abusively and implying that the [true] Faith is false. If they had said, \"We have heard, and we obey,\" and \"Hear us, and have patience with us,\" it would have been better and more appropriate for them. God has rejected them because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth. They have little faith"
