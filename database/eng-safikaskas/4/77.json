    "text": "[Prophet], are you not aware of those who have been told, \"Refrain from fighting, perform prayer, and pay the purifying alms?\" However, as soon as the fighting is ordained for them, some of them feared men even more than they feared God, saying, \"Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? If only You would give us just a little more time?\" Say to them, \"The enjoyment of this world is brief, whereas the life to come is far better for those who are mindful of God. You will not be wronged, not even a little bit"
