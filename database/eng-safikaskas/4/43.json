    "text": "Believers, do not attempt to pray while you are in a state of drunkenness, but wait until you know what you are saying; nor if you are in a state of major ritual impurity, until you have bathed, unless you are travelling and are unable to do so. If you are ill, are travelling, have relieved yourselves, or had intercourse, and cannot find any water, then find some pure dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God is always ready to pardon and forgive"
