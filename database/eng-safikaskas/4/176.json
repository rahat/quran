    "text": "They will ask you [Prophet] for a ruling. Say, \"God gives you a ruling concerning those who die childless and who have no surviving parents. If a man dies childless and has a sister, she will inherit one-half of what he has left, just as he will inherit from her if she dies childless. But if there are two sisters, then they are entitled to two-thirds of the inheritance between them, but if there are brothers and sisters, then the male is entitled to twice the share of the female.God makes this clear to you so that you do not go astray. God knows everything"
