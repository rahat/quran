    "text": "Some seek refuge with people with whom you are bound by a treaty, or they come over to you because their consciences forbid them to go to war against you or against their own people. Had God willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they withdraw and do not fight you, and offer you peace, God does not allow you to harm them"
