    "text": "So, believers, be careful when you fight in God's path, and use your discernment. Do not say to someone who offers you a greeting of peace, \"You are not a believer, aspiring for worldly goods. God has plenty of gains for you. You were once in the same position, but God has been gracious to you. Therefore, use your discernment. God is always aware of what you do"
