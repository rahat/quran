    "text": "[Prophet] When you are among believers and about to lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand up in prayer with you, taking their weapons with them. When they have finished their prayer, let them take up their positions at the back while another group, who has not yet prayed, come forward to pray with you, also on their guard and armed with their weapons. The unbelievers would love to see you unarmed, so that they might take you in a surprise attack. You will not be blamed for laying down your weapons, while you pray if you encounter heavy rain or are ill; But be fully prepared against danger. God has prepared a shameful and humiliating punishment for the unbelievers"
