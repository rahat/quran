    "text": "You are forbidden to take as wives your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal and maternal aunts, a brother's daughters, a sister's daughters, your wet nurse, your milk-sisters, mothers-in law, and your step-daughters- who are your foster children that are born of your wives with whom you have consummated your marriage. However, if you have not consummated your marriage, you will incur no sin [by marrying their daughters]. You are forbidden to marry the wives of your begotten sons, two sisters simultaneously: with the exception of what previously took place. God is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
