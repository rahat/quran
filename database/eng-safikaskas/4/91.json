    "text": "You will find others who wish to be safe from you, and from their own people, but whenever they are back in a situation where they are tempted [to fight you], they succumb to it. So if they do not withdraw, offer peace, or restrain themselves from hostility, seize and kill them wherever you encounter them. We give you clear authority against such people"
