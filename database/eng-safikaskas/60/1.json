    "text": "Believers do not take My enemies and yours as allies, offering them affection, when they have rejected the Truth that has come to you. They have driven you and the Messenger out, because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have decided to struggle in My way, seeking My approval, how can you secretly love them? I know what you concealed and what you reveal. Whoever among you does that is straying from the right path"
