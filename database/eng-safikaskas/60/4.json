We reject you, and there will be animosity and hatred forever between us and you until you believe in God alone.\" Except for Abraham's words to his father, \"I will ask forgiveness for you, though I cannot protect you from God\". \"Our Lord, in You we trust, and to You we repent. To You is the ultimate destination"
