    "text": "Believers, when believing women come to you as emigrants, test them. God knows best about their faith. And if you find them to be faithful, then do not return them to the unbelievers. They are not lawful wives for them, nor are they their lawful husbands. But give the unbelievers what they have spent. You are not to blame if you marry them later provided you give them their dues. And do not hold to marriage bonds with unbelieving women, but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent. This is God's judgment; He judges between you. God is All-knowing and All-Wise"
