    "text": "No bearer of burdens will bear the burdens of another and if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if they were related. You can only warn those who stand in awe of their Lord even though He is beyond the reach of their perception, and those who perform prayer. Whoever purifies himself [does so] for the good of his soul. God is the [final] destination"
