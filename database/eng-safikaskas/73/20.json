    "text": "Your Lord knows that you stay up praying nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, along with a group of those with you. God justly evaluates the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to sustain it, so He will not require it of you. Read from the Qur'an what you can. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking God's bounty; yet others will be fighting in God's cause. So read from it what is easy for you, and observe the prayers, and pay The purifying alms, and lend God a loan of goodness. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with God, improved and increased for you. Ask God's forgiveness, for God is Forgiving and Merciful"
