    "text": "God has fulfilled His promise to you when you, with His permission, were about to destroy your enemy. He showed you what you love, and then you failed, disputed and disobeyed. Some of you long for this world, and others long for the life to come. Then, in order that He might put you to a test, He kept you from winning. Then, later He pardoned you. God is gracious towards the believers"
