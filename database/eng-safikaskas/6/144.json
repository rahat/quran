    "text": "And a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Ask, \"Has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or that which is in the wombs of the two females? Were you present when God gave you these commands?\" Who then is more wicked than a person who, in his ignorance, attributes his own invented lies to God, and thus misleads people? God does not guide such wicked people"
