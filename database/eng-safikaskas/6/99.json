    "text": "It is He who sends down water from the sky. With it, We sustain all living growth, then bring greenery from it, and from that We bring out grains, one riding on the other in close-packed rows.From the palm tree comes dates in thick clusters, and there are gardens of vines and olive trees, and pomegranates, all so alike and yet so different. Watch their fruit while it ripens. In all this there are signs for the people who would believe"
