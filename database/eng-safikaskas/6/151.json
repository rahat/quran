Do not ascribe divinity to any one besides Him, relate to your parents in the best possible way, do not kill your children out of fear of poverty, since it is We who will provide sustenance for you and them. Do not commit any shameful deeds, whether they are in open or in secret, and do not take any human life which God has declared as sacred, other than in the pursuit of justice. This is what He commands you to do so that you may remember"
