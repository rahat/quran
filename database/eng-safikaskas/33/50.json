    "text": "Prophet, We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due wedding gifts, and those whom your right hand held in trust, given to you by God, and the daughters of your paternal uncles, the daughters of your paternal aunts, the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who migrated with you, and any believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to marry her, a privilege [exclusively] for you and not the rest of the believers. We know exactly what We have made obligatory to them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands hold in trust, hence you will not be at fault [if you act according to your privilege], for God is the All-Forgiving, the Mercy giver"
