    "text": "When you [Muhammad] said to the one whom God has blessed and you have favored, \"Keep your wife and be mindful of God,\" while concealing within yourself that which God was about to disclose. [In doing so] You feared people, whereas it is God whom you should fear. So, when Zayd divorced her, We married her to you. We do not want believers to have restrictions concerning their adopted sons' wives after they divorce them, for God's command must be carried out"
