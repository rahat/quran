Yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: \"Name them! Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth or is it (just) a show of false words.\" Nay! To those who disbelieve, their plotting is made fairseeming, and they have been hindered from the Right Path, and whom Allah sends astray, for him, there is no guide"
