Say (O Muhammad SAW): \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.\" And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (the deeds of those who are obedient to Him)"
