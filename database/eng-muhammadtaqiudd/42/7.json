And warn of the Day of Assembling, of which there is no doubt, when a party will be in Paradise (those who believed in Allah and followed what Allah's Messenger SAW brought them) and a party in the blazing Fire (Hell) (those who disbelieved in Allah and followed not what Allah's Messenger SAW brought them)"
