    "text": "Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim (Abraham) about his Lord (Allah), because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim (Abraham) said (to him): \"My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim (Abraham) said, \"Verily! Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; then cause it you to rise from the west.\" So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allah guides not the people, who are Zalimun (wrong-doers, etc)"
