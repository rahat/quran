    "text": "They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: \"In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.\" And they ask you what they ought to spend. Say: \"That which is beyond your needs.\" Thus Allah makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought"
