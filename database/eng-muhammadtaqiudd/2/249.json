    "text": "Then when Talut (Saul) set out with the army, he said: \"Verily! Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.\" Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: \"We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.\" But those who knew with certainty that they were to meet their Lord, said: \"How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's Leave?\" And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc)"
