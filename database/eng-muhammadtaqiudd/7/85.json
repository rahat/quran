[La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)].\" Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you; so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things, and do not mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, that will be better for you, if you are believers"
