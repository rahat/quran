    "text": "Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: \"We hear your word (O Muhammad SAW) and disobey,\" and \"Hear and let you (O Muhammad SAW) hear nothing.\" And Ra'ina with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). And if only they had said: \"We hear and obey\", and \"Do make us understand,\" it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few"
