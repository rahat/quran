Say (O Muhammad SAW): \"My Lord knows best their number; none knows them but a few.\" So debate not (about their number, etc.) except with the clear proof (which We have revealed to you). And consult not any of them (people of the Scripture, Jews and Christians) about (the affair of) the people of the Cave"
