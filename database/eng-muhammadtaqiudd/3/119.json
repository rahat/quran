You are the ones who love them but they love you not, and you believe in all the Scriptures [i.e. you believe in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), while they disbelieve in your Book, the Quran]. And when they meet you, they say, \"We believe\". But when they are alone, they bite the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: \"Perish in your rage.
