If this (Quran) is from Allah, and you deny it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel ('Abdullah bin Salam) testifies that this Quran is from Allah [like the Taurat (Torah)], so he believed (embraced Islam) while you are too proud (to believe).\" Verily! Allah guides not the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doing)"
