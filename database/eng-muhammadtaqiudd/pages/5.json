And as for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: \"What did Allah intend by this parable?\" By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-Fasiqun (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah)"
