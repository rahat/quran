We directed Musa (Moses) by inspiration, when his people asked him for water, (saying): \"Strike the stone with your stick\", and there gushed forth out of it twelve springs: each group knew its own place for water. We shaded them with the clouds and sent down upon them Al-Manna and the quails (saying): \"Eat of the good things with which We have provided you.\" They harmed Us not but they used to harm themselves"
