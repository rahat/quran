Show me how You give life to the dead.\" He (Allah) said: \"Do you not believe?\" He [Ibrahim (Abraham)] said: \"Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in Faith.\" He said: \"Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste.

His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people"
