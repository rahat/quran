Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save their ownselves, ignoring the others and the Prophet SAW) and thought wrongly of Allah - the thought of ignorance. They said, \"Have we any part in the affair?\" Say you (O Muhammad SAW): \"Indeed the affair belongs wholly to Allah.\" They hide within themselves what they dare not reveal to you, saying: \"If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,\" but that Allah might test what is in your breasts; and to Mahis that which was in your hearts (sins), and Allah is All-Knower of what is in (your) breasts"

But Allah, indeed, has forgiven them. Surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing"

Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed,\" so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allah that gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
