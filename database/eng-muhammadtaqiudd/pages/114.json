And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to others who have not come to you. They change the words from their places; they say, \"If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!\" And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Al-Fitnah [error, because of his rejecting the Faith], you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify (from disbelief and hypocrisy); for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment"
