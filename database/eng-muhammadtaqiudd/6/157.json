    "text": "Or lest you (pagan Arabs) should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they (Jews and Christians).\" So now has come unto you a clear proof (the Quran) from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah and turns away therefrom? We shall requite those who turn away from Our Ayat with an evil torment, because of their turning away (from them). [Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol. 8, Page]"
