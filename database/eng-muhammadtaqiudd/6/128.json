Many did you mislead of men,\" and their Auliya' (friends and helpers, etc.) amongst men will say: \"Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.\" He will say: \"The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allah may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing"
