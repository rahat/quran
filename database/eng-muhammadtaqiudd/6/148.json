    "text": "Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: \"If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).\" Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allah's Messengers), till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: \"Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie"
