    "text": "We have assigned only angels as keepers of the Fire, and We have made their number merely a stumbling block for the faithless, and that those given the Book may be reassured, and the faithful may increase in [their] faith, and that those given the Book may not doubt and the faithful [as well], and that those in whose hearts is a sickness may say, and the faithless [along with them], ‘What did Allah mean by this description?’ Thus does Allah lead astray whomever He wishes, and guides whomever He wishes. No one knows the hosts of your Lord except Him, and it is just an admonition for all humans"
