And when you have security —for those who enjoy [release from the restrictions] by virtue of the ‘umrah until the á¸¥ajj— let the offering be such as is feasible. As for someone who cannot afford [the offering], let him fast three days during the á¸¥ajj and seven when you return; that is [a period of] ten complete [days]. That is for someone whose family does not dwell by the Holy Mosque. And be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution"
