[For] such, He has written faith into their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him. He will admit them into gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. They are Allahâ€™s confederates. Look! The confederates of Allah are indeed felicitous"

You did not think that they would go out, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But Allah came at them from whence they did not reckon and He cast terror into their hearts. They demolish their houses with their own hands and the hands of the faithful. So take lesson, O you who have insight"
