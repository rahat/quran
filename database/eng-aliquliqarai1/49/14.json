    "text": "The Bedouins say, ‘We have faith.’ Say, ‘You do not have faith yet; rather say, ‘‘We have embraced Islam,’’ for faith has not yet entered into your hearts. Yet if you obey Allah and His Apostle, He will not stint anything of [the reward of] your works. Indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful.’"
