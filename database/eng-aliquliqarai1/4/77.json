    "text": "Have you not regarded those who were told, ‘Keep your hands off [from warfare], and maintain the prayer, and give the zakat’? But when fighting was prescribed for them, behold, a part of them were afraid of people as if fearing Allah, or were even more afraid, and they said, ‘Our Lord! Why did You prescribe fighting for us? Why did You not respite us for a short time?!’ Say, ‘The enjoyment of this world is little and the Hereafter is better for the Godwary, and you will not be wronged so much as a single date-thread"
