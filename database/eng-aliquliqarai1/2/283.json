    "text": "If you are on a journey and cannot find a writer, then a retained pledge [shall suffice]. And if one of you entrusts to another, let him who is trusted deliver his trust, and let him be wary of Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony; anyone who conceals it, his heart will indeed be sinful. And Allah knows best what you do"
