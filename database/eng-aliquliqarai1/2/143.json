    "text": "Thus We have made you a middle nation that you may be witnesses to the people, and that the Apostle may be a witness to you. And We did not appoint the qiblah you were following but that We may ascertain those who follow the Apostle from those who turn back on their heels. It was indeed a hard thing except for those whom Allah has guided. And Allah would not let your prayers go to waste. Indeed Allah is most kind and merciful to mankind"
