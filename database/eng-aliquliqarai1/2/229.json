    "text": "[Revocable] divorce may be only twice; then [let there be] either an honourable retention, or a kindly release. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything from what you have given them, unless the couple fear that they may not maintain Allah’s bounds. So if you fear they would not maintain Allah’s bounds, there is no sin upon them in what she may give to secure her release. These are Allah’s bounds, so do not transgress them, and whoever transgresses the bounds of Allah —it is they who are the wrongdoers"
