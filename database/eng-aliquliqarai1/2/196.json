    "text": "Complete the á¸¥ajj and the ‘umrah for Allah’s sake, and if you are prevented, then [make] such [sacrificial] offering as is feasible. And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its [assigned] place. But should any of you be sick, or have a hurt in his head, let the atonement be by fasting, or charity, or sacrifice. And when you have security —for those who enjoy [release from the restrictions] by virtue of the ‘umrah until the á¸¥ajj— let the offering be such as is feasible. As for someone who cannot afford [the offering], let him fast three days during the á¸¥ajj and seven when you return; that is [a period of] ten complete [days]. That is for someone whose family does not dwell by the Holy Mosque. And be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution"
