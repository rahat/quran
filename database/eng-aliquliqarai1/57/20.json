    "text": "Know that the life of this world is just play and diversion, and glitter, and mutual vainglory among you and covetousness for wealth and children â€”like the rain whose vegetation impresses the farmer; then it withers and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes chaff, while in the Hereafter there is a severe punishment and forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure; and the life of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion"
