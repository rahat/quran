Then, if you ascertain them to be faithful women, do not send them back to the faithless. They are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for them. And give them what they have spent [for them]. There is no sin upon you in marrying them when you have given them their dowries. Do not hold on to [conjugal] ties with faithless women. Ask [the infidels] for what you have spent, and let the faithless ask for what they have spent. That is the judgment of Allah; He judges between you; and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise"
