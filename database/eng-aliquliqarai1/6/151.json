That you shall not ascribe any partners to Him, and you shall be good to the parents, you shall not kill your children due to penury —We will provide for you and for them— you shall not approach indecencies, the outward among them and the inward ones, and you shall not kill a soul [whose life] Allah has made inviolable, except with due cause. This is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may apply reason"
