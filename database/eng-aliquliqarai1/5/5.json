    "text": "Today all the good things have been made lawful to you: —the food of those who were given the Book is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them— and the chaste ones from among faithful women, and chaste women of those who were given the Book before you, when you have given them their dowries, in wedlock, not in license, nor taking paramours. Should anyone renounce his faith, his work shall fail and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter"
