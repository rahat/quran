    "text": "O you who have faith! Do not violate Allah’s sacraments, neither the sacred month, nor the offering, nor the necklaces, nor those bound for the Sacred House who seek their Lord’s grace and [His] pleasure. But when you emerge from pilgrim sanctity you may hunt for game. Ill feeling for a people should not lead you, because they barred you from [entering] the Sacred Mosque, to transgress. Cooperate in piety and Godwariness, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression, and be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is severe in retribution"
