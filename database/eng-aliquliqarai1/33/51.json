    "text": "You may put off whichever of them you wish and consort with whichever of them you wish, and as for any whom you may seek [to consort with] from among those you have set aside [earlier], there is no sin upon you [in receiving her again]. That makes it likelier that they will be comforted and not feel unhappy, all of them being pleased with what you give them. Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah is all-knowing, all-forbearing"
