    "text": "They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Sacred Mosque, and kept the offering from reaching its destination. And were it not for [certain] faithful men and faithful women, whom you did not know â€”lest you should trample them, and thus blame for [killing] them should fall on you unawares; [He held you back] so that Allah may admit into His mercy whomever He wishes. And had they been separate, We would have surely punished the faithless among them with a painful punishment"
