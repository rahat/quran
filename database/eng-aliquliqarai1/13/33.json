    "text": "Is He who sustains every soul in spite of what it earns [comparable to the idols]? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah! Say, ‘Name them!’ Will you inform Him of something He does not know about on the earth, or of [what are] mere words? Rather their scheming is presented as decorous to the faithless, and they have been barred from the [right] way; and whomever Allah leads astray, has no guide"
