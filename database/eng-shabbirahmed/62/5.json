The example of those who were entrusted with Torah, and did not apply it in their daily lives, is that of the donkey that carries a load of books. Tough indeed is the example of people who deny Allah's Verses by their actions. Allah does not show the Way to people who displace the Revelation from its rightful station. ('Kizb' = Belie = Give lie = Deny in practice. 'Kufr' = Reject openly = Darkness = Denial = Ingratitude. 'Zulm' = Dislodge from the rightful place = Relegate the Truth = Give preference to other sources = Oppression = Wrongdoing = Violation of human rights)"
