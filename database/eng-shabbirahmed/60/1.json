    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not take My enemies - who are your enemies as well - for friends. Do you extend love and friendship to them when they reject the Truth that has come to you, driving out the Messenger and you because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If you are committed to strive in My Way and to seek My Approval, befriend them not. Do you show them friendship in secret, when I am best Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal? And whoever among you does that, he has certainly strayed from the right way"
