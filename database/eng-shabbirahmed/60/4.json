    "text": "Indeed there is an Excellent Pattern for you in Abraham, and his companions. They said to their folk, \"Verily, we stay clear of you and of what you worship instead of Allah. We denounce you and between us and you has arisen distance and aversion until you believe in Allah alone.\" The only exception was Abraham's saying to his father, \"I will indeed pray for your forgiveness, although I have no power to achieve anything from Allah on your behalf.\" Then he prayed, \"Our Lord! In You we place our trust, unto You we turn, and unto You is the Final Destination. (9:113), (14:41), (19:47), (3)"
