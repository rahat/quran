    "text": "O Prophet! When believing women come unto you taking oath of allegiance to you (they shall pledge that they will) - Not associate anyone with Allah. Not steal the rights of others. Not commit immodesty. Neither kill their children, nor deprive them of good rearing. Not indulge in fabricating slander, either overtly or covertly. Not disobey you in the Qur'anic Values. When they have made the pledge, accept their allegiance and ask Allah to bestow upon them the protection of forgiveness. For, behold, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
