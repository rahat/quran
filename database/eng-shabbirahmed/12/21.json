    "text": "The one who bought him in Egypt said to his wife, \"Receive him honorably. Take good care of him. May be he can help us or we can adopt him as a son.\" We, thus, established Joseph in Egypt and arranged for him proper education and training. He was gifted with a great insight into events. Allah's Command always prevails although most people won't understand the stages of cause and effect"
