    "text": "(Feeding of the disabled must be a matter of priority in your society.) There is no blame on the blind, nor is there blame on the crippled, nor there is blame on the sick or handicapped, to eat from your houses. Just as there is no blame on you for eating at your own homes, or your fathers' homes, or your mothers' homes, or your brothers' homes, or your sisters' homes, or your paternal uncles' homes, or your paternal aunts' homes, or your maternal uncles' homes, or your maternal aunts' homes, or the homes you manage and hold the keys of, or the home of a friend. You do nothing wrong by dining together or apart. But whenever you enter houses, salute one another with a blessed, goodly greeting from Allah. Thus Allah makes clear the revelations for you, so that you may understand (the goodness in them)"
