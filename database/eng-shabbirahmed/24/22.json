Let not those among you who have been blessed with resources and ease of life ever stay behind in spending on: Their families, Relatives, Those who have lost their jobs, Whose running businesses have stalled, Whose hard earned income is insufficient to meet their needs, and Those who have forsaken the domain of evil or persecution in the Cause of Allah. Let them pardon and overlook the imperfections of the needy. Listen! Do you not love that Allah should forgive you, absolving your imperfections? Thus it is - Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
