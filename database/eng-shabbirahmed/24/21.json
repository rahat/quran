    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Follow not the steps of satanic people in the community. Anyone who follows Satan's steps, should know that he advocates evil and vice. Had it not been for the Favor of Allah, and His Grace unto you, none of you could have grown in goodness. Thus it is - but anyone can develop the \"Self\" (attain Self-actualization) by following Allah's Laws (given in the Qur'an). Allah is Hearer, Knower (Most Perceptive of your psychosocial needs)"
