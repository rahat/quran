Those who ask permission are the ones who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission (O Prophet) in order to handle some of their affairs, grant them permission to whomever you can. Remember (their welfare during their absence) asking forgiveness for them, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
