Your wives, who are like my daughters, are permitted for you. Be mindful of Allah's Laws, and do not humiliate me in the presence of my guests. Is there not a single upright man among you?\" (Genesis 19:14 states that Lot offered them his own married daughters. Two daughters and the whole crowd! Nay, a Prophet is the spiritual father of his nation)"
