(The clergy have always done it with previous Scriptures, and they will do it again (2:79), (3:77), (6:113), (6:138-139), (9:34), (22:52)). Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are they who lied about their Sustainer.\" Oh, verily, Allah's rejection is the due of all those who displace right with wrong"
