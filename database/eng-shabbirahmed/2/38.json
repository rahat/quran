    "text": "We said, \"ALL OF YOU have degraded yourselves. But behold, when guidance comes to you from Me, those who will follow My guidance, there shall come upon them no fear, nor shall they grieve.\" (Note here the plural, 'All of you' confirming that Adam and his wife are allegorical terms for the humankind. Incidentally the word EVE is nowhere mentioned in the Qur'an, once again pointing to Adam as mankind)"
