    "text": "(The exhortation of righteousness must not be considered confined to the Month of Ramadan.) They ask you (O the Messenger) about the phases of the Moon. Say, \"They should serve as signs to mark certain timings for people. And for Hajj.\" (Misconceptions and superstitions about the sun and the moon have nothing to do with righteousness). You attain righteousness by upholding the Commands in a straightforward manner. Exponential development of humanity cannot be achieved by entering the System through the back door of ritualism - just as you must not enter houses through the back doors (2:177). (Since there is no such thing as a part-time Muslim) you shall be mindful of Allah all the time in order to reap a rich harvest. ((2:)"
