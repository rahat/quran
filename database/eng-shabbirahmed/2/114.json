    "text": "And who can be a greater transgressor than the one who forbids access to the Centers of the Divine System? - Lest His Name be Eminent in the earth (as it is in the rest of the Universe) - And strives to ruin them! It is not meet for their human dignity that they should enter them except in awe, respect and humility. ((9:17-19), (9:107)). Communities that fail to heed this warning will suffer humiliation in this world and a tremendous suffering in the Hereafter. (72:18). ('Masjid' = Mosque = Centers that administer the Divine System = Place of collective prostration with mind and body = Centers that the Islamic government will establish to implement the Qur'anic Commands in the society, and thus collectively submit to Allah)"
