    "text": "Satan, your selfish desire, scares you with poverty; that if you spent on others, you might become destitute. It teaches you stinginess to the extent of shame. Allah, the All-Embracing, All-Knowing promises you the protection of Forgiveness from Himself, and abundant Bounty. (And, In the Divine Order, the society would return to you more than you spend on it)"
