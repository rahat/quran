    "text": "After divorce, women shall wait three menstruations before remarriage. There is no waiting period for a woman who is divorced before intimate relations with her husband (33:49). And it is three months if they do not habitually menstruate (65:4). They shall not conceal pregnancy if they believe in Allah and in the Hereafter. In case of pregnancy, their waiting period shall be until delivery (65:4). And during this period their husbands would do better to take them back if both of them desire reconciliation. The husband and the wife have the right to reconcile during this waiting period of the wife. Women have rights similar to those of men in mutual kindness. Men, however, do not have a waiting period for remarriage for obvious physiological reasons. That is where men are on a platform different from them. ((2:228-234), (4:3), (4:19), (4:35), (4:128), (33:49), (58)"
