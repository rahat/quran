    "text": "A crucial step toward the establishment of this Unified Order will be the equitable distribution of wealth. People ask you, O Messenger! \"What should we spend in the Cause of Allah?\" Say, \"Although welfare of the entire society would remain the ultimate objective, begin this goodness with your parents, family and relatives, orphans, widows, and those who are left helpless, those whose hard earned income is insufficient to meet their basic needs, those whose businesses have stalled, and those who have lost their jobs, also the needy wayfarer, the homeless son of the street, and the one who has come to your town in a destitute condition.\" And whatever good you do, Allah is Aware of it"
