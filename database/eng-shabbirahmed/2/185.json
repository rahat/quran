    "text": "The month of Ramadhan has been chosen for your collective training because this is the month in which Revelation of the Qur'an began (with the most revolutionary and Benevolent Message ever). It is Guidance for mankind, and it clearly explains the 'why' of every Rule. And it is the Criterion of right and wrong. So, whoever is at home during this month should participate in the program. Whoever of you is sick or on a journey, let him do Abstinence later. Allah desires for you ease. He desires not hardship for you - and that you should complete the period. (Do not treat this program as just a ritual). The objective of this training is to establish the Greatness of Allah on earth for having placed you on a well-lighted road, and then being practically grateful by sharing His Bounties with others"
