    "text": "(The one who makes a will, the testator, is likely to make errors of omission or commission.) So, if anyone, who has heard the will, fears from a testator some bias or diminishing of a due right, and then makes proper adjustments to bring about an amicable and acceptable settlement between the concerned parties, he will not be harming his own character. Verily, Allah is Absolver of imperfections, Merciful. ('Ithm' = A dragging violation that harms the human personality or potential)"
