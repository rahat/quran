    "text": "(But if they keep on fighting), subdue them wherever you find them. And drive them out from where they have driven you out. For, oppression, cruelty and persecution are even more severely destructive than the killing in battle. And fight not against them near the Sacred House that is a Symbol of unified submission of all mankind to their Creator, unless they attack you therein. But if they attack you there, then fight against them. Such is the reward of those who refuse to acknowledge and then violate the sanctity of the Sanctuary of Peace for all humanity. (The Sacred Masjid in Makkah must be a safe Sanctuary and a source of peace and security for all mankind (2:144-148), (3:96), (5:2), (5:97), (9:18), (22:25-28), (40:19), (48:25). 'Qatl' = Kill = Bring low = Subdue = Fight = Attack = Slay"
