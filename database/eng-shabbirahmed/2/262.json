    "text": "Those who spend their wealth in the Cause of Allah, must remember that they have not obliged any persons. Therefore they do not afflict them with reminders of their generosity ((17:26), (30:38)). Their reward is with their Lord. (The society will return their generosity in this life as well). There will be no fear for them from without, nor grief will touch them from within"
