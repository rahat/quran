    "text": "Allah tasks not and expects not from anyone more than his capacity. Any challenges that come your way, afford you a chance to expand your \"Self\". For the \"Self\" is what it earns and against it is only what it deserves. Pray, \"Our Lord! Take us not to task if we forget or miss the mark! Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us as you did place on those before us. Our Lord! Impose not on us what we have not the strength to bear! Pardon us, absolve us, and bestow Grace on us, You are our Supreme Master, so help us prevail over those who reject the Truth"
