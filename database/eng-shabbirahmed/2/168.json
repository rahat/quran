Eat of what is on earth, Lawful, clean, wholesome, decent and pleasing, and of your liking, and let not your selfish desire lead your reason and judgment, step by step into error. Behold, your rebellious desire (Satan) is an enemy that lays bare even your hidden imperfections. ('Tayyab' = Clean, decent, wholesome, pleasing, aesthetically good, of your choice)"
