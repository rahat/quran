    "text": "And when there comes to them the Book of Allah, confirming the authentic in what they have, they flatly deny it although before that they had been praying for a signal victory over those who denied all Divine Revelation. And whenever there came unto them something that they recognized as the Truth, they would deny it. Then, deprivation of Allah's grace is the lot of all those who thanklessly reject His Guidance and choose to live in darkness. ('Kufr' includes all the meanings given in the last sentence)"
