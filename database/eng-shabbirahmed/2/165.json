    "text": "Yet, among mankind are those who consider idols and saints to possess the Attributes of Power and Control like Allah does, and revere them as only God should be revered. But the true believers revere Allah more than all else. (7:3). Oh, that those who relegate the Truth could but see, as see they will when they are made to suffer! They will realize that all Power belongs to Allah alone and that Allah is Awesome in punishing. (Reverence or love of Allah, in the Qur'an, invariably denotes obeying His Commands)"
