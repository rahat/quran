    "text": "Abraham prayed, \"My Lord! Make this land peaceful and secure, and provide its people with fruits of Your Blessings. Provide for those who believe in Allah and in the Last Day.\" He answered, \"I will also provide for him who thanklessly rejects the blessed guidance and let him enjoy life for a while. (But since he coveted instant gratification only and disregarded the long term), then, after that I will commit him to the suffering of Fire.\" And what a miserable destination it is after wandering through the journey of life! ((14:37), (17:18-20), (2)"
