    "text": "(The Covenant We made with the Children of Israel was not of unconditional favors.) When We made a promise with the Children of Israel, (We said), \"Serve none save Allah, and be kind to your parents, and to relatives, and to orphans, widows, and to the needy - those left alone in the society, and those whose income has stalled for any reason. And speak to people and treat them nicely, and establish the Divine System in the society, and set up the Just Economic Order (keeping your wealth open for the benefit of all).\" Then, after that, you slid back, except a few of you, and you backslide even now"
