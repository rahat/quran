    "text": "Would any of you wish that he had a beautiful, bountiful garden of dates and vineyards with rivulets flowing underneath it, but while age catches up on him and he has feeble offspring, a fiery tornado suddenly strikes and consumes it? This is how Allah wants you to reflect upon the Long Term. Your contribution to the society ensures you the Garden which neither a tornado, nor a hurricane dare take away from you"
