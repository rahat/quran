And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear evidence of the Truth and We strengthened him with Sacred Revelation. Yet is it not so that Whenever a Messenger came to you with something that was not to your liking, you became stubbornly arrogant, and some of them you called impostors, and others you killed? (Also, you have attempted to strike a deal with the Messengers in order to alter the Messages (10:15), (11:113), (1)"
