(Preoccupy yourselves with petty desires instead of higher goals). Go back in shame to Egypt and you will get what you demand.\" So humiliation and misery were stamped upon them and they had to face the Divine Requital. That was because they kept denying the Messages of Allah. And in the past they had opposed and even killed some Prophets in their transgression. They did all this, because they chose to rebel against the Divine Commands, and crossed the moral bounds"
