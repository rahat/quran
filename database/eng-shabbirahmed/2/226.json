    "text": "Men who take an oath that they will not approach their wives shall have four months of grace. And if they go back on their oath during these four months, behold, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. (They must rethink their decision during this grace period and circumstances might change. Similar rules apply for women, since they have rights and obligations as men have, and since no man is permitted to forcibly keep his wife in wedlock against her will as stated later in the Book ((2:228), (4:19), (4:21), (4)"
