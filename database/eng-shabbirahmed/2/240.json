    "text": "Men must testify in a written, legal will that, after their death, their widows will receive one year's maintenance without their being obliged to leave the house. But, if they leave on their own accord, there is nothing wrong in letting them do whatever they wish to do with themselves in a lawful manner. Allah, the Almighty, the Wise grants this permission"
