    "text": "We know your eagerness O Messenger, to fulfill Our Command and to establish Ka'bah as the Center of Devotion for all humanity. Soon, you will happily administer the Sacred Masjid that is dear to you for its Sublime objective. Wherever each of you is, keep your focus on it as a symbol of pure Monotheism, and of your Ideological uniformity. Behold, those who have been given the Scripture know that your call is the Truth from their Lord. (They remain bent upon denial for blind following, prejudice and arrogance). Allah is not unaware of what they do"
