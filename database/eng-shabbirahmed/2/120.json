Say, \"Behold, Allah's Guidance is the only True Guidance.\" (This is the updated, unadulterated Message from the same Creator who revealed the previous Scriptures). And, indeed, if you followed their desires after the Knowledge that has come unto you, then no ally nor helper would you have from Allah. ((7:3), (10:)"
