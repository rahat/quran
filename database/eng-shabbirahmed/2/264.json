    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injuring the self-respect of the recipients; like those who spend their wealth for show-off. This kind of behavior contradicts the true belief in Allah and His Law of Recompense. Charity has been ordained to help individuals and not to hurt them (93:10), and Allah has promised you manifold reward. But, a seed won't grow on a dusty rock, upon which rain falls and washes it clean. Even Allah won't guide those who deny such simple realities"
