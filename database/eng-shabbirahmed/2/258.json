    "text": "Think of the one who adamantly argued with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had given him power (Nimrod Shaddad, the King of Babylon who used to proclaim divinity). Abraham said to him, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" (Being a tyrant king he could reverse or impose death penalty upon his subjects). Abraham said, \"Allah makes the sun rise from the East; make it rise from the West.\" Thereupon the rejecter of the Truth remained dumbfounded. And Allah does not guide people who displace reality with falsehood"
