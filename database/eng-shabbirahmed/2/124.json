(He took up the formidable challenge of a mighty priesthood, idolatry and a tyrannical autocracy in Mesopotamia). Then his Lord said, \"Behold, I have appointed you an exemplary leader of mankind.\" He asked, \"And of my generations as well?\" He replied, \"My Promise does not embrace those who harm others, and thus, harm themselves.\" (Being the offspring of a great man shall avail none)"
