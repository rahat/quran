    "text": "(Now, see the other side of the coin.) And convey happy news to those who have chosen to be graced with belief, and have done acts of service to humanity. (For them will be a most pleasant reward. Call it Paradise in both lives. Try to understand it in your current vocabulary). Plush Gardens with rivulets flowing underneath! When they are provided with the delicious fruit of their deeds therein, they will say, \"This is the provision we were given before.\" They had tasted some of the reward in this world. For, they will be given sustenance that will recall that past. The men and women will have pure companions therein, an everlasting happy family life. (Remember, this Paradise is not given away as charity. It has to be built in this life and then inherited (14:25), (2)"
