There is no stand possible for you, so, go back.\" And some of them even sought permission of the Prophet, saying, \"Behold, our homes are exposed (to the enemy).\" (With the believers firmly entrenched around the town) their homes were not really exposed. They wanted nothing but to flee. (Yathrib = Madinah)"
