    "text": "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves and their own people. (Seeing that he is as a father to them), his wives are their mothers. In accordance with Allah's decree the relatives have a higher claim (in matters of inheritance) than other believers and the immigrants. Nevertheless, you are to deal with your friends in kindness. All this is recorded in this well-written and well-scored Book. (2:180,) (4:11), (9:111), (3)"
