    "text": "Allah did not give any man two hearts in his chest. (You cannot be a believer and a disbeliever at the same time). And He never regards your wives as your mothers because of your senseless utterances, such as your declaring them as your mothers. (2:226), (58:2-4). Nor does He regard your adopted sons as your biological sons. These are mere words that you utter with your mouths, but Allah declares the Truth and shows the Way"
