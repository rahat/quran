Tell your wives, \"If you desire the life of this world and its glitter - well, then, I shall provide you to your contentment and let you go in a becoming manner.\" (The Prophet had chosen not to keep a standard of living higher than the poorest of Madinah, and the mothers of believers were seeing other women living in relative affluence)"
