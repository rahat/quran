    "text": "(In earthly life human beings conceal many negative feelings that they have towards others even though they may have cordial relations with them). We will remove all negative emotions from their hearts. There will be no such feelings amongst the dwellers of earthly and heavenly Paradise wherein streams will flow. (The blessings of such a Social Order would be everlasting!) They will say: \"All Praise is due to Allah Who has guided us to such a beautiful destination. Without Divine guidance we would never have reached this place. Allah's Messengers brought to us this Truth. It will be proclaimed: \"This is the Paradise which you have inherited; and since you have inherited this Paradise as a result of your own effort, you will not be expelled from it"
