    "text": "The dwellers of Hell will say to the dwellers of Paradise, \"Give us something of the life-giving resources and the provisions bestowed on you by Allah.\" They will reply, \"Allah has made these things forbidden to the rejecters of His Laws.\" (The hellish societies will expect Allah's provisions to be granted to them as free-bees. They will be told that Allah's Bounties can only be achieved by establishing the Right System, and His Law forbids these Bounties to the rejecters)"
