    "text": "(They even venture into predicting the end of the world.) They ask you (O Messenger), about the Hour, when the end of the world will come to pass. Say, \"That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will manifest it at the appropriate time. Heavy it is in the heavens and the earth. It will come upon you suddenly.\" They ask you as if you could gain insight into this mystery with persistent inquiry. Say, \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah only. But most people do not know that even Messengers were not given this knowledge"
