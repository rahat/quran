    "text": "When Moses arrived at the appointed time, and his Lord spoke to him, Moses said, \"My Lord! Show me Yourself, such that I can see You.\" His Lord said, \"You cannot see Me. The best way to see Me is to look at this mountain and think. If you contemplate, you will understand that even a single mountain is made of countless atoms that were scattered. Then consider that you have seen Me.\" Realizing this, Moses imagined the Glory of His Lord through His signs in the Universe. He was stunned and when he recovered his senses, he said, \"Infinite are You in Your Glory! I feel embarrassed and repent at my question. I am among the foremost believers.\" (The 7,359 feet high Mount Sinai is standing to this day. Therefore contrary to popular literal translation of this verse, its understanding in allegorical terms is preferred. Also, a Prophet of God is unlikely to make a demand to behold God in physical form)"
