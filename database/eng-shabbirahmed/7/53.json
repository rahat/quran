Are there any intercessors to intercede on our behalf? Or can we be returned that we behave differently from our past?\" They have put their \"Self\" in loss and their own forgery fails them. (They will seek mediation for their mutual conflicts and long for starting from scratch. Since they have hurt their \"Self\", they have lost the power of judgment and they would need help. They have been fabricating unworkable systems)"
