    "text": "O Prophet! When you men intend to divorce women, make sure that the waiting period is observed. Keep precise account of this interim. Be mindful of Allah, your Lord. Never expel them from THEIR homes, nor shall they themselves leave their homes unless they commit open immorality. These are, then, the limits imposed by Allah. And whoever crosses Allah's limits, he verily hurts his own 'Self'. You know not that Allah may bring about thereafter a new situation (help create reconciliation)"
