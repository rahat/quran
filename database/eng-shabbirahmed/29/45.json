    "text": "(O Prophet) convey to people all that is revealed to you of the Book, and establish the Divine System. For, verily, establishment of the Divine System will shut off lewdness, stinginess and behavior contrary to the Divine Values. This is so, because Allah's Law is the Greatest Law that can give you eminence. And (O People) Allah knows whatever you contrive on your own. (21:10), (21:24), (23:70), (43:43-44), (70:21-27) - 'Fahasha' includes miserliness and 'Munkar' is all behavior that goes against Divine Values given in the Qur'an"
