Tell those who adamantly relegate the Truth, \"We believe in the Divine Origin of what has been bestowed upon us, as well as what has been bestowed upon you. For, our God and your God is One and the same and to Him we surrender.\" ((2:79). 'Zulm' = To relegate or displace something from its rightful place"
