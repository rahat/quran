    "text": "For, every one of them We took to task for his trailing behind in human virtue. And so, upon some of them We let loose a deadly storm wind; and some of them were overtaken by a sudden blast; and some of them We caused to be swallowed by the earth; and some of them We caused to drown. And it was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. (The Law of Requital never discriminates between people, whether individuals or nations)"
