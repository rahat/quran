    "text": "Those who abstain from the greater transgressions that deplete the communal energy, and from shameful deeds and stinginess, even though they may sometimes waver, behold, your Lord is Immense in absolving their imperfections. He knows you best since He brings you into being from the earth, and when you were still hidden in the bellies of your mothers? Therefore, claim not piety for yourselves. He knows best as to who walks aright"
