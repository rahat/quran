    "text": "Jews and Christians say, \"We are God's children and his loved ones\". Ask them \"Why does He then, task you to retribution for your transgressions?\" Nay, you are but human beings of His creating. He forgives and punishes according to His Laws. The Dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in between them, belongs to Allah. To Him is the Final Destination of all"
