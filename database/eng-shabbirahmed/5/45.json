    "text": "For Jews, We had decreed in the Torah, \"Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and equal injury for injury\". If one forgoes retaliation by way of charity, it shall absolve his or her imperfections. Whoever does not judge or rule according to what Allah has Revealed, such are the wrongdoers. (The Final Revelation of Allah, the Qur'an has updated Laws for all humanity for all Times. Exodus in the Bible does not leave room for forgiveness on the subject)"
