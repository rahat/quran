    "text": "We also made a Covenant with those who say, \"We are Christians.\" But they ignored a good part of the Message that was sent to them and forgot what they were told to bear in mind. As a result, Our Law has caused enmity and hatred among them till the Resurrection Day, when Allah will inform them of what they contrive. (Rivalry based upon Sectarianism and Nationalism, a natural consequence of deviating from the True Message, whether people call themselves Jews, Christians or Muslims)"
