    "text": "(The Divine System wants people to contribute to the society.) The Jews say, \"Allah's hand is tied down.\" It is their hands that are tied down. Their uttering deprives them of Allah's Grace. His hands are wide open and He showers His Bounties according to His Laws. (O Prophet) Since the Revelation given to you by your Lord brings about a Benevolent Revolution in the society, people with vested interests hate it. Many of them plunge deeper into transgression and disbelief. Consequently, Our Law has sent down into their hearts and ranks animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Allah has put down the flames of war that they repeatedly ignited. They try to create corruption and disorder in the land and Allah does not love the corruptors"
