Do not violate the symbols set up by Allah, nor the Sacred Months (2:194), nor the gifts, nor the camels for use as transport or sacrifice, nor the garlands marking them, nor the people who proceed to the Sacred Sanctuary, Ka'bah, seeking Allah's Blessings and Approval. When you have completed the Hajj, you are free to hunt. Let not your hatred of a people lead you into transgression, because they prevented you from going to the Sacred Masjid (48:25). Help one another in acts of collective benefit and in being mindful of Allah, and do not help one another in deeds that hurt humanity and in creating a wedge between people. Be mindful of Allah's Laws. His Law of Requital is strong in grasping"
