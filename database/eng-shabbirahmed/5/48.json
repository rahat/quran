    "text": "To you (O Messenger) We have sent the Book in Sure Truth confirming the Divine Origin of whatever Scripture was before it. The Qur'an is the Watcher over the old Scriptures and guards the Truth in them. So, Judge between people by that which Allah has revealed to you and follow not their wishes away from the Truth that has come to you. Now has come to all of you the Divine Law, and a traced-out Way. If Allah had willed, He could have made all of you humans a single people. But, He decided to let you choose your own path after showing you the Truth, and thus test yourselves. Outdo one another in actions that serve humanity and thus grow your \"Self\". To Allah is your final Destination, of all of you. Then He will make you understand where you differ"
