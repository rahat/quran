    "text": "Rejecters of the Truth certainly are those who proclaim that God is Messiah, son of Mary. The Messiah himself taught them, \"O Children of Israel! You shall worship God, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever associates deities with Allah, for such Allah has forbidden Paradise and their abode is the Fire. For those who displace Truth with falsehood there will be no helpers"
