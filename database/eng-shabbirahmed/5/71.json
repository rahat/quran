    "text": "They persisted in their violations thinking they could escape requital. As a consequence, they became blind and deaf to reason. But, there is plenty of room for forgiveness in Allah's Law. They took corrective actions and attained Allah's Mercy. Yet again, a great many of them faltered and fell blind and deaf. Allah is Seer of what people do"
