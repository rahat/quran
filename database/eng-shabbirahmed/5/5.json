    "text": "This Day, all good food of your choice is made Lawful for you. The food of the People of the Scripture is Lawful for you. And your food is Lawful for them. You are permitted to marry chaste women of the People of the Scripture, (provided they do not indulge in SHIRK i.e. not associate anyone with Allah (2:221)). You are permitted to marry the virtuous, chaste women among the believers and the virtuous, chaste women of those who were given the Scripture before. You must give your brides a generous marital gift and live with them in honor, not in fornication as secret lovers. (It must be an honest wedlock (4:24)). Anyone who rejects belief, all his work will go vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter"
