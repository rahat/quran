    "text": "Indeed Allah made a Covenant with the Children of Israel. We appointed twelve leaders among them. Allah said to them, \"I am with you so long as you follow the Divine Commands, spend your wealth for the community, believe in My Messengers, assist them, and give a beautiful loan to Allah (that is paid back to you manifold in both lives (2:261)). I will absolve your imperfections, help you create balance in the society and admit you to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. But, whoever among you disbelieves after this, will go astray from the Right Path"
