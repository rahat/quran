    "text": "Those who had stayed behind will say - if you go forth to a battle that holds promise of a booty, \"Allow us to follow you.\" They seek to change the Word of Allah. Say, \"You shall by no means go with us. This is what Allah has decreed already.\" Then they will say, \"You are envious of us.\" Nay, but very little it is that they understand (of selfless service). (The battle is no longer to be seen as a means of winning booty, it is allowed only for liberty and self-defense. That is the Word of Allah (8:1), (2:167), (2:)"
