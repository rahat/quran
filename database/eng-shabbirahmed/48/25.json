    "text": "These are the very people who denied the Message, and debarred you from the Sacred Masjid, and prevented your offerings from reaching their destination. Therein were believing men and believing women whom you did not know, and you could have harmed them. And on their account you could have carried guilt without knowing it. Thus Allah admits into His Grace whoever seeks it. Now if the rejecters persist in aggression, We shall indeed clearly separate them (from the believers) and punish them with an awful doom"
