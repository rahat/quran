    "text": "Whatever Allah has turned over to His Messenger from those communities belongs to Allah and His Messenger (the Central Authority). (The Messenger will spend it on): The Central Government (The Central Authority). The welfare of the families of the believers. The orphans. Those who still feel left alone in the society. The widows. Those who have no means of earning their livelihood. The disabled who cannot move around looking for the Bounty of Allah. The homeless son of the street. Those who are on their way to join you, and Those who travel a distance to seek help"
