    "text": "He it is Who got out the rejecters among the People of the Book from their dwelling places at the very gathering of the forces. You deemed not that they would leave and they deemed that their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah reached them in a manner they little expected and caused awe in their hearts. So they dismantled their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the believers. Learn a lesson, then, O You who have vision"
