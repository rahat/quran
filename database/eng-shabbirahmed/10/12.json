    "text": "When affliction befalls man, he cries unto Us, whether he be lying, or sitting or standing. But when We have relieved him of the affliction, he goes his way as if he had never cried unto Us for what afflicted him. Those who trespass the Divine Laws, lose discernment and even their ill deeds then seem fair to them"
