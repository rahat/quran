If my presence among you and my announcement of Allah's Messages are hard on you, well, I have put my trust in Allah. Decide then upon what you are going to do against me, and call to your aid your \"partners\". And once you have chosen your course of action, let no hesitation deflect you from it. Then have a go at me and give me no respite"
