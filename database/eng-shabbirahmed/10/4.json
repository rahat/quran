    "text": "To Him is your ultimate return, all of you. Allah's Promise is the unwavering Truth. He creates the first creation, and He will create it again so that every action may have its Just Recompense. Those who attained belief and worked to augment the society will have their just reward. And those who rejected the Truth, for them will be a burning draught of despair and a painful doom because of their persistent refusal to acknowledge the Truth. (A consequence of their own doings (33:24), (34:3-4), (45)"
