Let those who are endowed with insight take this to heart. (Danger signs have been posted on the highway of life as the caravan of humanity moves along to the Noble goal of Peace. God is the Sustainer and Cherisher of all humanity and His Law is Supreme (1:1), (114:1). Men and women of understanding and discernment, and those of history, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and those in positions of authority must pay heed to what their Lord is telling them (9:31-33), (14:48), (18:48), (4)"
