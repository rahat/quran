    "text": "Without exception their Messengers said to them, \"Yes, we are human beings like you. Allah gives His grace of Revelation to whom He chooses among His servants. We work within the Laws of Allah that preclude the performance of supernatural miracles.\" (The right way to attain firm belief is reflecting at the Universe, within our own selves, at the accounts of history, and upon these verses. That is the general approach of the Book). \"Then you can attain the belief whence you can firmly put your trust in the never changing Laws of Allah"
