    "text": "All mankind will appear before Allah. Then the ones who had disabled their minds with blind following will say to their 'self-glorified' leaders, \"We used to follow you. Can you divert some of the requital from us?\" The leaders will respond, \"If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. Ah, it is too late! Now it makes no difference whether we panic in grief or try to bear it in patience, there is no escape for us.\" (It is noteworthy here that Satan had brought the same argument that his Lord sent him astray)"
