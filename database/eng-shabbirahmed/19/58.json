    "text": "These are some of the Prophets whom Allah Blessed. They all were from the descendants of Adam, the early humans. The descendants of those whom We carried with Noah on the Ark, and the descendants of Abraham and Jacob, the Israel. We guided them and selected them (so that they could guide people). Whenever the Messages of the Most Gracious were conveyed to them, they would fall down prostrate in tears. (In total submission they put their hearts into their mission)"
