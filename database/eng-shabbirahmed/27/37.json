    "text": "Solomon said to the envoys, \"Go back to them, (and tell them that) we verily will come to them with forces they cannot withstand. We shall drive the leaders out of power and humiliate them to shame.\" (Historically the Kingdom of Sheba flourished from 1100 to 115 B.C. At their zenith they were the richest nation in the world. Their economy was based on excellent agriculture and international trade. They had the most advanced irrigation systems of the times, with great water dams. Their Kingdom included today's whole of Yemen, Somalia and Ethiopia, and boasting a strong army, they frequently had expansive designs further south and up north. As the inevitable result of worshiping multiple false deities, including the sun, their society was not without inequities of caste and creed. Solomon, the King and the Prophet, planned to subdue the Sheba Empire to thwart their aggressive designs and to protect the region from oppression. And he succeeded magnificently. Queen Bilqis of Sheba and her nation embraced Solomon's Message and reverted to the worship and obedience of the One True God)"
