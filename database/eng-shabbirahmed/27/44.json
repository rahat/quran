    "text": "She was escorted to the palace. It was said, \"Enter the hall.\" When she saw the smooth polished glass floor, she thought that it was a pool of water and she was spellbound. ('Kashafat 'an saqaiha' idiomatically means that she was spellbound, and not that she bared her calves; a common error of many translators. For example, tying one's hand to the neck means miserliness). Solomon said, \"This is a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass.\" She said, \"I have been doing wrong to myself, and now I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\" (She realized that following the Divine Laws ensures the best bounties in this life as well. There are some historical accounts that Solomon and Bilqis got married. But the Rabbinical Talmudic traditions propose that they committed adultery then and there, out of which Nimrod Nebuchadnezzar, the tyrant emperor of Babylon was born! That is of course inconceivable of a Prophet of God)"
