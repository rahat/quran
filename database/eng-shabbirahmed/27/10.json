    "text": "Allah (revealed Guidance to Moses and) said, \"Now rehearse the Truth.\" When Moses did that, he felt that he had the vibrant Force of Truth in hand. Yet he was awe-struck by the uphill task before him, like grabbing a huge dragon. God said, \"O Moses! Fear not - behold, the Messengers fear not in My Presence.\" (Please note 'kaannaha jann' = as if it was a dragon, concerning the 'asa' or staff in (27:10). Additional Tasreef: (7:108), (20:17-24), (26:10-15), (26:32-33)"
