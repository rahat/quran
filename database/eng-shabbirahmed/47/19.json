    "text": "So (O Prophet) remain consciously and incessantly aware that there is no 'power' but Allah, and protect yourself against the rumors and slander that the enemy sticks after you, and the believing men, and the believing women. Devise means to counter whatever may cause your community to lag behind in their Mission. For, Allah knows (the meticulous ways) how you move about in your daily lives and what your blessed destination is. ('Wastaghfir' = Protect. Zanb = Tail = Rumors and slander that are stuck behind one's back = Lagging behind like the tail lags behind an animal's body)"
