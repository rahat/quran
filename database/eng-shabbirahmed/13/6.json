    "text": "(Instead of helping you establish and consolidate the Divine System on earth), they challenge you (O Prophet) to hasten the disaster that strikes nations when they ignore the Divine Values. Sufficient precedents have been set for them in the form of exemplary punishments to generations before them. Now, behold, your Lord is Full of forgiveness for people despite their wrongdoing. But, behold, your Lord is also Strict in retribution! (He has decreed the Law of Respite during which period people can safely mend their ways)"
