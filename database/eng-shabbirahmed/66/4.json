    "text": "If you two turn in repentance to Allah, (it shall be good for you) since your hearts had deviated. But if you back up each other against him (in divulging family matters), then, behold, Allah is with him, and so is Gabriel (who brings the Revelation), and the righteous believers. Also angels are his helpers. ('Angels' here denotes perseverance, restraint, courage, resolve, contentment (3;126), (8:9), (9:26), (33:56)). (Here is the absolute refutation of the Hadith collectors who obnoxiously peep into fabricated accounts of the Prophet's private life)"
