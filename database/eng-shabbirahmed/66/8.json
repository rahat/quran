    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance. Your Lord will then erase your misdeeds, and admit you into the Gardens underneath which rivers flow - on the Day when Allah will not let be degraded His Messenger and those who are with him in Faith. Their Light will run ahead of them as grace for them. They will say, \"Our Lord! Perfect our Light for us making it last forever, and absolve our imperfections. Verily, You are Controller of all things"
