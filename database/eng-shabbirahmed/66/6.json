(Family life must be a matter of trust and confidence) so guard yourselves and your families against a Fire whose fuel is people and their stone hearted leaders. The guardians of this Fire are the invincible, changeless Divine Laws that never fail to execute Allah's Ordinance, and carry it out without exception"
