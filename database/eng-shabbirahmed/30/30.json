    "text": "Therefore, set your purpose for the Upright System of Life. That resonates with Allah's Law of Origination (of the Universe) including the origination of mankind. Allah's Law of and for His Creation is unchangeable and, therefore, trustworthy. This Universal System is Perfect, but most people know not. (Allah has initiated the Universe with a Sublime Plan wherein all things are committed to His Law, and mankind being a part of that Plan, must live by His Law)"
