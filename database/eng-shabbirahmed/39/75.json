    "text": "And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne of the Almighty's Supreme Control extolling their Lord's Glory and Praise. And all will be judged aright. And they will say in concert, \"All Praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\" (Allah's physical Laws in the Universe will help the guided mankind establish the Divine Rule on earth, as it is in the Cosmos. And the Divine System in the lives of mankind will make them truly see that all Praise indeed belongs to the Giver of such Benevolent Guidance)"
