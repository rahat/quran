    "text": "Know and make it known that the Pristine Religion is for Allah and from Him alone. And yet, they who take patrons besides Him say, \"We worship them for no other reason than they bring us nearer to Allah.\" (5:35), (10:18), (17:57). Behold, Allah judges them (right in this Revelation) concerning that wherein they differ. Verily, Allah does not intervene to guide anyone who is a liar unto himself, thankless to his own detriment"
