But as soon as We grant him Bliss from Us, he says, \"I have been given this by way of skillful knowledge.\" Nay, this affords them a test of their character. But most of them know not that they do not know enough. ('La Ya'lamun' pertaining to knowledge, in my opinion, carries a double connotation here as rendered. And, however intelligent and skillful an individual may be, Divine Laws and the society work in concert toward his success)"
