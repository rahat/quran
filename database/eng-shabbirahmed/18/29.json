Whoever accepts it, let him accept it, and whoever rejects it, let him reject it.\" Verily, for all those who wrong their own \"Self\" We have readied billowing folds of fire to surround them. When they beg for water, they will be given their burning hot deeds that backfire on their faces, a drink of distress they gave others. (9:34-35). How dreadful a drink, and how terrible a resting place"
