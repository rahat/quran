    "text": "(There is a lesson of perseverance for you in the history of the Dwellers of the Cave). Hold fast to the company of those who remember their Lord morning and evening seeking His Approval. (6:52), (8:52-54), (89:29:30). And let not your eyes overlook them in quest for the beauties of this world. And pay no heed to any whom Our Law has made to forget Us because he only follows his desires, and abandons all that is right"
