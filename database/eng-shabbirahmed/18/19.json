One of them asked, \"How long have you been here?\" \"We have been here a day or part of a day!\" they answered. Finally they said, \"Your Lord knows best how long. (They were so committed to their mission that they hardly noticed how the days and nights went by). Let one of you go with these silver coins to the town, and look for the best available food, and bring you some provisions. But let him exercise caution, and by no means make anyone aware of you"
