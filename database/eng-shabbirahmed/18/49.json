    "text": "The Book (Qur'an) will be laid open before all humanity and you will behold the guilty filled with fear what they see therein. Legislation at that time will be based on the Book. Those who were used to stealing the fruit of others' labor will be scared. They will say, \"Oh, woe unto us! What kind of a Book is this! It leaves out nothing, be it small or great, but takes everything into account!\" In the Divine System every deed, small or big will come forth (53:39-40). Universal Justice will prevail since your Lord does not wrong anyone. (This verse applies to the Hereafter as well in the form of the Divine Record Book, just as Hell and Paradise are frequently mentioned in the Qur'an applying to both lives)"
