    "text": "As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town. And there was a treasure for them, beneath the wall. Their late father was a righteous man, and your Lord wanted them to grow up to full maturity and then extract their treasure as a Mercy from your Lord. I did it not of my own accord (but carried out the Divine Command). This is the explanation of things you could not stand.\" (As the pondering was over, Moses understood that Revelation is to the intellect what the sunlight is to the eye. Thus ended his intellectual journey. Later on Moses was commissioned to Prophethood and experienced the Divine Revelation first hand)"
