But angels (the Divine Laws) practically extol their Lord's Glory by protecting the Order in the Universe. Oh, verily, Allah! He alone is the Absolver of imperfections, the Merciful. ('Malaekah = Angels = Divine Laws in the Universe. 'Yastaghfirun' = They help protect like a helmet protects the head. 'Sabh' = Swim in strides = Doing one's best)"
