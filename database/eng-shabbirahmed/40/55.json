And dispel and guard yourself against the slander and schemes of the alarmists, intended to cause dissension. And extol the Glory and Praise of your Lord night and day, working hard to set up the Divine Order for everyone to behold that He is Praiseworthy. (47:19), (48:2) - 'Zanb' also means sticking a blame or slander behind one's back for character assassination"
