    "text": "Moses said, \"Go away then, for good! In this life it is for you to say, \"Touch me not!\" And moreover you have a promise that will not fail. (People will consider and treat you as untouchable as before, and the suffering of the Hereafter is inescapable). Now, look at your god to whom you were so devoted. Verily, We will burn it and scatter its ashes far and wide over the sea.\" (Moses wanted his people to behold the powerlessness of the false deities and their potential to divide humanity)"
