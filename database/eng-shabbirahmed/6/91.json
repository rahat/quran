    "text": "People do not value Allah as He must be valued when they say, \"Allah has not revealed His Message to any human being.\" Ask them, \"Who then revealed the Scripture which Moses brought, a Light and Guidance for people? Although you put it down on parchment which you show, but you conceal a lot. You were taught what neither you, nor your ancestors knew before.\" Say, \"Allah (revealed it).\" Then leave them to play at their vain talk"
