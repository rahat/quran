    "text": "Allah Commands you further: Approach not the wealth of the orphan except for their own benefit until they come of age with full maturity of body and mind. Give full weight and full measure in all your dealings. Uphold justice in all aspects of your life. Our Commands are meant to widen your human potential. We do not assign any \"Self\" responsibility beyond its means. And when you voice an opinion, be just, even if it is against a relative. Fulfill your Covenant with Allah, the unwavering allegiance to the Divine System (1:4-5), (9:111). This He Commands for you to bear in mind"
