They set aside a portion of Allah's provision of crops and cattle and claim, \"This is for Allah, and this is for our idols.\" But the share of their idols never reaches Allah, and the share of Allah does reach their idols. What an unjust decision they make! (Their priesthood devours both portions of their making, and the poor remain wanting. To Allah reaches what you spend on the needy)"
