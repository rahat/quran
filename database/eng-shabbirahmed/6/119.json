    "text": "Why should you not eat of that on which Allah's Name has been pronounced (i.e. it is not dedicated to other than Him)? He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden along with certain exceptions in dire need (5:3). Numerous of the clergy mislead people in this matter without knowledge, and with their personal opinions. Verily, your Lord is fully Aware of those who go beyond moderation"
