    "text": "(Our Light revives the living dead and makes them walk honorably among mankind.) Is one who was dead and We gave him life with Light that enables him to move among people, equal to one in total darkness from which he cannot come out? (When people have their belief system jumbled up, they lose the power to distinguish between the right and wrong). Hence, the rejecters of the Truth find their own deeds pleasing"
