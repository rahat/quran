    "text": "In spite of the demands of the rich and powerful leaders, you shall not turn away the poor who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His Approval. They are responsible for whatever good and bad they have done, and their toiling in labor is respectable in the Sight of Allah. Likewise they are not accountable for you. If you repelled them, you shall be of the wrongdoers"
