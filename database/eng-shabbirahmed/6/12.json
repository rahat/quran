    "text": "(From history, let them turn their attention to the Universe). Say, \"To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"To Allah Who has prescribed for Himself Mercy.\" (He nourishes the entire Universe as a mother's womb nourishes the fetus with no returns, while meeting its needs at all stages of development. He does not task individuals and nations to doom, without giving them a period of respite to mend their behavior). He will assemble all individuals and nations on the Day when humanity stands on its feet, and ultimately on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. Only those who have destroyed their \"Self\" will keep denying the Truth"
