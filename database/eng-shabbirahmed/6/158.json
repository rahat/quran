    "text": "Are they waiting for angels, your Lord, or some physical miracles to come to them? On the Day one of such Signs comes, no person will benefit from declaring belief if he did not believe before. Or who, while believing, did not do good works. (Belief has to be based on Reason and it must lead you to a productive life). Say, \"Keep on waiting (for miracles), we too are waiting (for the results of our efforts)"
