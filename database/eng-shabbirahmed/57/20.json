    "text": "Know that (in comparison to Eternity) the life of this world is only play and a fleeting delight and decor and your mutual bragging, and pursuit of riches and children. Its example is that of rain - The plantation which it causes to grow, pleases the farmers. But then, it may wither and you can see it turn into yellow hay. And in the end it crumbles into dust! But in the Hereafter it is either grievous suffering or forgiveness from Allah and Approval. Again, the life of this world is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment of illusion. (Therefore, invest in the life to come for lasting rewards)"
