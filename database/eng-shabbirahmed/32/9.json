    "text": "(Then Emergent Evolution took place that distinguished humans from the Animal Kingdom.) He shapes him in accordance with what he is meant to be, and breathes into him (something) of His Energy. (This something is a special gift to the humans in the form of free will). And thus (O Mankind) He gives you the faculties of hearing, and sight, and feelings as well as minds. Yet, how seldom are you grateful by making the best use of your perceptual and conceptual faculties"
