But you are sent as an act of your Lord's Grace, to warn people to whom no Warner has come before you, so that they may reflect. ((32:3), (36:6). Prophet Ishmael, the ancestor of Arabs, cannot be considered a Prophet to them since Children of Ishmael multiplied and inhabited Arabia as the Arab community long after his death. See (2:125) and introduction to Surah 11 Hud"
