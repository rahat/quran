    "text": "And one day the young Moses entered the city at a time when most of its people were resting unaware of what was going on in the streets. And there he encountered two men fighting with each other. One was of his people (a Hebrew) and the other of his (Egyptian) adversaries. His tribesman cried out to him for help against the one who was of the enemies - Whereupon Moses struck him with his fist and thus, (accidentally) brought about his end. But then he said to himself, \"This is of Satan's doing! Verily, he is an open enemy, a misleader.\" (Moses, not yet commissioned to Prophethood, was denouncing his emotions)"
