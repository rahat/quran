On the Day when they shall see what they are promised, it will seem to them as if they had not lived in the world more than an hour of the day. A Clear Message! Shall anyone perish except those who drift away from the right path? ('What they are promised' enfolds the glad tiding if they choose to walk aright and, in that instance, they will feel that a new blissful chapter of life dawns upon them. On the other hand, 'What they are promised' enfolds grievous suffering if they persist in their denial of the Truth)"
