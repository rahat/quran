    "text": "The Jews say, \"Uzayr is God's son,\" while the Christians say, \"The Messiah is God's son.\" They only utter baseless themes with their mouths, following in spirit assertions made in earlier times by people (like the Greeks and Zoroastrians) who denied the Truth! Allah condemns them. They are surely deluded. (Some Jews in the Arabian Peninsula used to believe that Osiris, the Egyptian idol, was God's son while others thought of Ezra, who restored the Torah after it had been lost in the Babylonian Exile, as God's son)"
