    "text": "(The hypocrites) swear by Allah that they have said nothing wrong. Yet they most certainly have uttered a word of disbelief (9:61-62). And have denied the Truth after professing their surrender to Allah. They were aiming at something beyond their reach (attaining inner peace without sincerity to the Divine Guidance). And they could find no fault in the Divine System except that Allah has enriched them and caused His Messenger to enrich them out of His Bounty. Hence, it will be good for them if they repent and correct themselves. But if they still turn away, Allah will cause them to suffer grievous retribution in this world and in the life to come. And they will have no protector or helper in the earth"
