    "text": "People of Madinah, and the Bedouins around, should not stay behind the Messenger. Nor shall they prefer their lives to his life. For, any thirst, effort or hunger that afflicts them in the Cause of Allah, or a single step that they take that angers the rejecters, and whatever gain they gain from the enemy, becomes a credit, a good deed recorded for them. Allah never loses the wages of the doers of good"
