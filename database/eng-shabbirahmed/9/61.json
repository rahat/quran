He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe.\" Those who vex and hurt the Messenger of Allah, for them is an awful punishment. (The Messenger is not an emperor or a king who keep guards around them. He is accessible to all at all time and it is good for you that he pays attention to everyone)"
