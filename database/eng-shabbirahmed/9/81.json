    "text": "Those (hypocrites) who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the Messenger of Allah, and disliked to strive with their wealth and persons in Allah's Cause. They said, \"Let us not go forth in heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is more intense\", if they but understood. (And the aggressors could soon bring the heat of the conflict to their homes)"
