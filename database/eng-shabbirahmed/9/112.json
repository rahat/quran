    "text": "Triumphant are those who: Return to the Right Path and take corrective action as soon as they feel that they have erred. Obey the Commands of Allah. Praise Allah in word and action by serving His creation. Pick up lessons from travel and from history. Are always humble before the Divine System. Adore Allah alone. Promote the Qur'anic Values, and resist the non-Qur'anic customs. Guard against trespassing the Limits ordained by Allah. These are the men and women who deserve a pleasant life in both worlds (33:35), (66:5). Give them the glad tiding (O Messenger)"
