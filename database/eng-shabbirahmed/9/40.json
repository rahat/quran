    "text": "If you do not help the Messenger, Allah will help him, as always. When the disbelievers drove him out of his home, they were just two men. They had to seek refuge in a cave. The Messenger said to his companion, \"Grieve not. Surely, Allah is with us.\" Then Allah sent His reassuring peace upon him, and supported him with invisible forces of faith and courage (9:26). He made the word of the disbelievers utterly low. Allah's Word remains Supreme, for Allah is Mighty, Wise"
