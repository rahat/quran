    "text": "Altering the Sacred Months is only an addition to disbelief. It increases the straying of the disbelievers. They keep the total count of the Sacred Months as four, but keep shifting them within the same year or from year to year. Thus they allow what Allah has forbidden. Their evil actions seem pleasing to them. Allah does not intervene to guide those who have decided to live in darkness"
