    "text": "Verily, Allah enjoins (the Permanent Values in this Book that you): Uphold Justice. Benefit humanity. Give to your family, relatives (and fellow-men). Stay away from all that is shameful and immodest. Shun everything that runs counter to reason. Do not withhold your wealth and resources just for yourself. Guard yourself against envy. Do not create rebellion in the society. ('Fahasha', 'Munkar' and 'Baghii' include the last five meanings). And He admonishes you repeatedly that you bear all this in mind"
