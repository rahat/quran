    "text": "Fight not the hypocrites who join a people with whom you have signed a peace treaty. And fight not those who come to you wishing not to fight you or their believing relatives. Had Allah willed they could have fought against you. Therefore, if they leave you alone, and offer you peace, Allah has opened no way for you but the way of peace. Your prime duty remains the establishment and defense of the Divine Order in which there is no room for revenge"
