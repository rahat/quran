    "text": "Have you seen those who have been told, \"Curb your hands, and establish the Divine System and set up the just Economic Order?\" But as soon as the Command came to fight, some of them feared men as they should have feared Allah, or even more. They say, \"Our Lord! Why have You ordained fighting for us? If only You had granted us a little more delay!\" Say, \"Brief is the enjoyment of this world, whereas the life to come is the best for those who walk aright. None of you shall be wronged a hair's breadth"
