    "text": "Obey Allah and associate no partner with Him. Treat kindly your parents, relatives, The orphans, And those who have been left alone in the society. Take care of the needy, The disabled, Those whose hard earned income is insufficient to meet their needs, And those whose businesses have stalled, And those who have lost their jobs. You shall treat kindly your related neighbors, And unrelated neighbors, Companions by your side in public gatherings, Or public transportation. Be generous to the needy wayfarer, the homeless son of the street, and the one who reaches you in a destitute condition. Be nice to people who work under your care. Allah does not love the proud and boastful"
