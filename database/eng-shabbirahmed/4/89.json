    "text": "These hypocrites wish that you reject Belief and become like them. Do not consider them friends unless they practically demonstrate that they have changed, and move along with you in the Way of Allah. But if they persist in their behavior of being with you in word, and against you in action, they are more dangerous than your open enemies. Then subdue them regardless of which group they belong to, and choose no friend or helper from among them"
