    "text": "Those believers who sit back, except for a disability, are not equal in ranks to those who strive with their wealth and person in the Cause of Allah. Allah has granted a grade higher to those who strive with their wealth and person than that granted those who remain passive. Although Allah has promised the ultimate good to all believers, yet Allah has exalted with immense reward those who strive, above the ones who sit back at home"
