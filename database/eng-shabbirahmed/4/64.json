    "text": "We have sent no Messenger but that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave. They are not sent with hypotheses, but to show people how they can establish an equitable society, in which people flourish individually and collectively. They attain personal development and become worthy of immortal life in the Paradise (89:29). If anyone hurts his or her \"Self\" by transgressing His Laws, or wrongs a member of the community, he or she must come to the Messenger, the Central Authority of the System, to make amends. Sitting back at home and praying in hiding won't help (9:102-105), (20:82), (5:10). The Messenger will then, decide the matter seeing if there is room for forgiveness in the Divine Law. Such is the Moral Order that the Messenger has inculcated in the hearts and in the society where one becomes the watcher over one's own \"Self\" (8:74-75), (9:100), (48:29), (59:8-9). Indeed, there is plenty of room for making amends, and for mercy in the Divine System. Allah is Acceptor of repentance, Merciful"
