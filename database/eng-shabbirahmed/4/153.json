    "text": "(O Prophet) People of the Scripture ask you to bring a published book from the sky. They made a greater demand to Moses when they said, \"Show us Allah face to face\". And their psyche was such that when a bolt of lightning struck around them, they fell in fear (2:55). They had displaced the true belief with falsehood. After that, they chose the calf for worship although they had seen the Manifest Truth. Yet, We pardoned them and gave Moses evident authority (as a blessing for their guidance)"
