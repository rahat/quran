Allah has drawn Boundaries of Law to help you safeguard this crucial pre-requisite. Those who refrain from trespassing these Boundaries are the ones who have obeyed the Divine System established by the Messenger. They shall be admitted to the everlasting Promised Garden that has all the aesthetic elegance that the human mind could ever imagine. That is the Supreme Success"
