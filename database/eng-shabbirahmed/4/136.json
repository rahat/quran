    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! (and call yourselves Muslims)! Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the Book He has revealed to His Messenger, and ( the fact that He revealed) the Scripture before. (Belief to the point of Conviction can only be attained through reason and not as a birth right (12:108)). One who denies Allah, and His Angels, and His Books, and His Messengers, and the Last Day, has gone far astray"
