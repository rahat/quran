    "text": "Some of those who are Jews, distort words to give a different meaning. They say, \"We hear and disobey,\" and \"Your words are falling on deaf ears,\" and \"Be our shepherd,\" and they twist their tongues to mock the DEEN. It would have been better and more upright for them to say, \"We hear and obey,\" and \"We hear you,\" and \"Please watch over us and guide us.\" Instead, they have incurred deprivation from the Grace of Allah due to their denial of the Truth. Few of them will embrace belief"
