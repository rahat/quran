    "text": "(The hypocrites adopt the opportunistic attitude.) They watch you and wait. If a victory comes to you from Allah, they say, \"Weren't we with you?\" And if the rejecters get a portion of success, they say, \"Did we not side with you and protect you from the believers?\" Allah will judge between you all on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will not give the rejecters (of the Qur'an) any way of success against the true believers in the Qur'an"
