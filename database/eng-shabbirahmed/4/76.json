    "text": "Believers fight in the Cause of Allah, that is, for the removal of tyranny and in self-defense (benign aggression). And the rejecters of the Truth fight in tyranny and for their selfish desire to oppress people (malignant aggression). So fight against those friends of Satan. Verily, Satan's plan is feeble because the selfish desire fails before the Divine Law of Requital"
