    "text": "Satan (Iblis) in allegorical terms had said, \"I surely will lead them astray, I will entice them, confound them.\" (2:34-36), (7:11), (15:30-32), (17:62), (18:50), (20:116), (38:74). According to Satan's promise, these representatives of his mislead men and women away from the Qur'an, and confound them with ritualism and superstitions, such as magic, dreams, astrology, amulets, numerology, ghoul, exorcism, and vain beliefs. Marking cattle's ears, choosing red cows or black goats for specific sacrifices, are superstitions that the clergy propagates. They try to present the Laws of Allah operative in the World of Creation in a distorted fashion. They assign miracles to living or dead \"saints\" ignoring the Law of Cause and Effect (4:51), (4:60). Whoever befriends this handiwork of Satan, has ignored Allah. Such a person is verily a loser and his loss is manifest"
