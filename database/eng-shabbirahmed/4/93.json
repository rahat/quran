    "text": "Whoever slays a believer intentionally, his or her maximum punishment, considering the circumstances, is up to capital punishment (2:178), (5:32-33). His requital shall be Hell, therein to abide, and Allah will condemn him, and reject him and prepare for him awesome suffering. (Unjust killing of any human being, regardless of color, creed, religion or sex is a grievous offense that is tantamount to slaying the entire humankind (5:32). Hence, the offender shall be punished accordingly. Intentional murder of any human being is also a crime against the State, therefore, the State would be responsible for tracing, arresting and trying the offender in a court of law. QISAS = the duty of tracing an offender for just recompense"
