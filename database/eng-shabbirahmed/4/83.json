    "text": "The Book of Allah provides easy and practical social guidance. There are people who spread rumors pertaining to safety or fear. Those who hear rumors shall refer the matter concerning public safety and threat, to the Messenger and the government officials. Those who are engaged in obtaining intelligence will indeed know what to do with it. Had it not been for the Bounty of Allah and His Mercy, most of you would still be following the Satanic elements"
