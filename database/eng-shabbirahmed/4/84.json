    "text": "O Messenger! Fight in the Cause of Allah. You are responsible only for your own actions. While conveying the Revelation is your prime duty, you also teach the believers wisdom, knowledge and self-development by serving humanity (2:151). Therefore, inspire the believers to overcome all fear of death. Allah may well restrain the fury of the unbelievers who are bent upon destroying the System. Allah is Strongest in Might, Strict in Restraining"
