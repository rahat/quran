    "text": "The rightly guided is the one who follows Allah's Guidance. Anyone who quits His Way, has gone astray. You will not find any protectors for them outside His Laws. On the Day of Resurrection, We will gather them together prone upon their faces; blind, dumb, and deaf. (That is how they lived their life). Hell is their abode, and every time its flames abate, We shall increase for them its blazing flame"
