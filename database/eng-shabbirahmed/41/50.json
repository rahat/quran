And if I am indeed brought back before my Lord, then, behold, with Him is even better return for me.\" (I shall be favored there as I am favored here). But We certainly will tell the ungrateful all that they did. And certainly We will make them taste heavy punishment. ('Ma Li' = For me, from me. 'As-Sa'ah' = The Hour = Resurrection = Revolution = Turn of fortunes = Time)"
