And no fruit emerges from its sheath, and no female ever conceives, nor gives birth, but according to His Laws of Science. And so, on the Day He will call them, \"Where are now those 'partners' of Mine?\" They will say, \"We confess to You, none of us sees them around here.\" ('Ilm = Knowledge = Skill = Science)"
