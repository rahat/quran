He does not task individuals and nations to doom, without giving them a period of respite to mend their behavior). He will assemble all individuals and nations on the Day when humanity stands on its feet, and ultimately on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. Only those who have destroyed their \"Self\" will keep denying the Truth"
