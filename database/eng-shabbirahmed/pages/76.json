Those who emigrated, or were driven out of their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and fought and were slain, I shall blot their inequities. The imprints of their misdeeds on their \"Self\" will be erased. I shall admit them into Gardens with rivulets flowing beneath.\" A Reward from Allah. And with Allah is the best Reward"
