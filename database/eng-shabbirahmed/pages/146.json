No one will eat of them except whom we permit.\" They also arbitrarily prohibit the riding of some animals (saying that it has been dedicated to some elite or saint. Aren't such VIP favors very much alive in the modern day JAHILYAH?) And there are cattle over which they pronounce not the Name of Allah (but of someone else to please people). Such are their fabrications in His Name. Soon He will reward them for their false imagery"
