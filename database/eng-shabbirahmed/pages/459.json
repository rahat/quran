And He has bestowed upon you cattle of eight kinds in pairs. (Sheep, goat, camel, cow - male and female, the common permissible livestock (6:144-146).) He creates you in the bellies of your mothers, creation after creation, in threefold depths of darkness (the abdominal wall, the uterine wall and the embryonic sac). Such is Allah, your Lord! Unto Him belongs the Kingdom. There is no god but He. How, then, can you sway like errant winds"
