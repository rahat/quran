Saul, in order to create discipline among his soldiers and to test their resolve commanded them to refrain from drinking that water, save a sip out of the hand. But except for a few they drank it. Their behavior was hardly strange when they crossed the rivulet. They complained, \"This day we cannot cope with Goliath and his armies.\" But those who were resolute and were convinced that they were marching forward in the Cause of Allah, said, \"How often a small force has overwhelmed a big army since it is the Law of Allah that He is with those who are proactively steadfast"

Then Allah honored David with a powerful kingdom, along with wisdom and sound judgment, and commissioned him for the special Office of Knowledge. We have decreed that those who spend their youth in righteousness, i.e., benefiting humanity, shall be granted knowledge and wisdom ((12:22), (28:14)). The annihilation of the mighty armies of Goliath bears a historical lesson for mankind that if Balance in Nature were not one of the Laws, tyrants would ransack the earth and its inhabitants unopposed. But, oppression brings revolution and eventually, the oppressed overthrow the oppressors (22:39). Allah is Limitless in His Bounties to the Worlds"
