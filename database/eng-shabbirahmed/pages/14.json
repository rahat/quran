And whenever there came unto them something that they recognized as the Truth, they would deny it. Then, deprivation of Allah's grace is the lot of all those who thanklessly reject His Guidance and choose to live in darkness. ('Kufr' includes all the meanings given in the last sentence)"

(Grudgingly, they cannot get over the fact that Allah has chosen a Messenger who is not an Israelite). And that Allah should reveal His bounty to whomever He chooses among His servants. And so (for their discriminatory attitude) they have invited Requital upon Requital. And for all those who thanklessly deny the Guidance and choose to live in darkness, is a logical consequence of suffering that brings them low"

The desire to worship a tangible deity was so strong in them that their hearts were infused with the love of the calf, because of their persistent failure to see the Truth. Say, \"If your faith teaches you to go back to the primitive ways of worship, then you are in a pitiable state of mind - if you are at all believers"
