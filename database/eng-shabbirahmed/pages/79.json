If they had no children, then the wives get one-fourth of what the husband leaves behind. If they had children then the wife gets one-eighth. If a man or a woman, whose inheritance is in question, was a loner, in the sense of leaving behind no ascendants or descendants, but leaves behind a sister and a brother, each of them gets one-sixth of the inheritance. If there are more than two siblings, they equally share one-third of the inheritance. For a deceased who has no living parents, see (4:176), (4:177) The above applies after fully satisfying the will, and after paying of all debts, so that no one's rights are infringed upon. This is the Will decreed by Allah who is All-Knowing, Clement"

Allah has drawn Boundaries of Law to help you safeguard this crucial pre-requisite. Those who refrain from trespassing these Boundaries are the ones who have obeyed the Divine System established by the Messenger. They shall be admitted to the everlasting Promised Garden that has all the aesthetic elegance that the human mind could ever imagine. That is the Supreme Success"
