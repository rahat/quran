            "text": "On the other hand, there are people who keep their wealth open for the society in sincere submission to Allah, not for show off, and not for putting anyone under obligation. They have joined hands with Allah in Purpose and have strengthened their \"Self\" (13:33). They have achieved self-actualization and made themselves truly worthy of immortality (20:76). Remember, that a \"Self\" that has not been developed by giving to community in wealth or labor, merely survives ((14:17), (43:77), (69:27)). Immortality is not a spontaneous gift from Allah; men and women are candidates for it (91:9-10). Such people are creating the Paradise of their own making that is ever-blooming; rain or shine. This glad tiding is relayed to you from Allah. Who can be a better Watcher and Guarantor of explaining the intricacies of your psyche and actions than the One Who created you"

This is how Allah wants you to reflect upon the Long Term. Your contribution to the society ensures you the Garden which neither a tornado, nor a hurricane dare take away from you"

Spend on others the good things you have honorably earned with hard work, whether it is from the product of industry or from the produce of the earth. Do not give away something that you won't like to receive except with closed eyes. Know that Allah, the Rich, Owner of Praise, provides you indiscriminately and without return"

Allah, the All-Embracing, All-Knowing promises you the protection of Forgiveness from Himself, and abundant Bounty.
