While another group was anxious with their own feelings and wrong assumptions about Allah due to ignorance. (They were hypocrites worried for their lives). They said, \"Do we have any control?\" Tell them, \"All control belongs to Allah.\" You can control events only within the framework of His Laws. These hypocrites concealed within themselves what they did not reveal to you. They said, \"If we had nothing to do with this battle and had stayed home we would not have been harmed.\" Say, \"Had you stayed in your homes, those destined to be killed would have crawled themselves to the circumstance of death.\" Allah thus lets you test your real convictions. Allah is Aware of what is in the hearts"

Do not be like disbelievers who grieve that if their brethren had stayed home with them, rather than going out traveling or defending, they wouldn't have died or been killed. Such attitude creates anguish in the hearts according to Allah's Laws. Fear of death takes away \"life\" out of life. Allah gives life and causes death and Allah is Seer of your behavior"
