And you support one another in hurting the community and sowing the seeds of discord. And when these homeless people get enslaved by others and are brought to you, you ransom them, whereas it was unlawful for you to evict them in the first place. What! Do you wish to accept one part of the Scripture and reject the other? Think then, what the reward of such wrongdoing must be, nothing but disgrace in the life of this world - and on the Day of Resurrection the most grievous chastisement! For Allah is not unaware of what you do. (The verse is referring to the Jewish community of Madinah, but as is always the case in the Qur'an, the Commands have a wide historical applicability - in this case, to oppressive societies anywhere anytime)"

Yet is it not so that Whenever a Messenger came to you with something that was not to your liking, you became stubbornly arrogant, and some of them you called impostors, and others you killed? (Also, you have attempted to strike a deal with the Messengers in order to alter the Messages (10:15), (11:113), (1)"
