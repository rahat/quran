But, those who openly reject Our Messages and those who deny them in practice - it is they who will be companions of the Insurmountable Barrier (that bars their \"Self\" from developing)"

Its example is that of rain - The plantation which it causes to grow, pleases the farmers. But then, it may wither and you can see it turn into yellow hay. And in the end it crumbles into dust! But in the Hereafter it is either grievous suffering or forgiveness from Allah and Approval. Again, the life of this world is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment of illusion. (Therefore, invest in the life to come for lasting rewards)"

Such is the Bounty of Allah which He bestows upon him who wills it. And Allah is the Lord of a tremendous bounty"
