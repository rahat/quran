They keep the total count of the Sacred Months as four, but keep shifting them within the same year or from year to year. Thus they allow what Allah has forbidden. Their evil actions seem pleasing to them. Allah does not intervene to guide those who have decided to live in darkness"

The Messenger said to his companion, \"Grieve not. Surely, Allah is with us.\" Then Allah sent His reassuring peace upon him, and supported him with invisible forces of faith and courage (9:26).
