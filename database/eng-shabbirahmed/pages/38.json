But, never make a secret pledge or contract with them. Speak with them honorably and in recognized words. Do not tie the wedding knot nor sign the martial contract until the waiting period has ended. Know that Allah understands human psyche, and that which is in your hearts. Take heed of Him and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement. He does not wish to impose hardship on you. His Laws protect your society from harm by absolving your imperfections. (Allah, the Clement never gets enraged and His Rule is the Rule of Law)"

This would be an unexpected situation involving emotional trauma. Therefore, show compassion by giving her as generous a gift as you can afford. This would be an act of equity and it is a binding duty on all those who wish to be counted among the benefactors of humanity"

If the move for divorce originates purely from you, let her have the whole portion. If you men forgo it, it is closer to righteousness. O People! Never forget kindness among yourselves. This Command is from Allah Whose Law of Requital ever monitors your actions and the motives behind them"
