Behold, We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given the marital gift, and those women who have sought asylum with you and signed the marital contract (6:10). Also lawful for you in marriage were daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who had migrated with you. And lawful for you is a believing woman who offers herself freely to the Prophet and whom the Prophet might be willing to wed. This latter is but a privilege for you, and not for other believers. We have already made known what We have decreed regarding their wives and women who have sought asylum in their homes. This arrangement is designed to ease any social difficulties on you (O Prophet, as the Head of the State). Allah is Absolver of imperfections, Merciful"
