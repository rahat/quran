            "text": "Forbidden for you (2:173) for dietary consumption are: Any Animal that dies of itself. Blood. The flesh of swine. And anything (not just meat) that has been dedicated to any other than Allah (such as an idol, grave or saint). Any Animal that has been strangled to death. Beaten to death. Dies by falling from height. Gored to death by horns. Animal eaten by a wild animal unless you are able to slaughter it while it is still alive. That which is sacrificed on altars (devotional stones or blocks in shrines considered sacred). Also forbidden is dividing the meat through raffling and games of chance (2:219), (5:90). This Day, the rejecting opponents have given up the hope of eradicating your DEEN, System of Life. Clear distinction in matters of the Lawful and the Unlawful draws a tangible line between their ways and your way. Fear them not but fear Me. This Day, I have perfected your DEEN for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen for you Islam as the System of Life. (There is no hardship in Islam (2:185)). Therefore, if one is forced by hunger to consume the Unlawful, with no intention of exceeding the limits, Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"

As for the hunting animals, the catch of your trained dogs and falcons, as Allah has taught you, is Permissible. Mention Allah's name thereupon. Always be mindful of Allah's Laws. His Law of Requital is swift in reckoning"

You are permitted to marry chaste women of the People of the Scripture, (provided they do not indulge in SHIRK i.e. not associate anyone with Allah (2:221)). You are permitted to marry the virtuous, chaste women among the believers and the virtuous, chaste women of those who were given the Scripture before. You must give your brides a generous marital gift and live with them in honor, not in fornication as secret lovers. (It must be an honest wedlock (4:24)). Anyone who rejects belief, all his work will go vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter"
