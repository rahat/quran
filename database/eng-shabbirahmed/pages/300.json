All Prophets were chosen by birth but assigned their mission at a later date. The young Moses knew that the human intellect was the source of conceptual knowledge whereas the Divine Revelation is the extrinsic knowledge from beyond human faculties.) And so, in the course of his quest for knowledge Moses said to his young friend, \"I shall not give up until I reach the junction of the two streams, though I march on for ages in my quest.\" (INTELLECT AND REVELATION -- the two streams of knowledge)"
