If one dies and leaves no children, and he had a sister, she gets half the inheritance. If she dies first, he inherits from her if she left no children. If there were two sisters they get two-thirds of the inheritance, if there are sisters and brothers, the brother would get twice the share of the sister for reasons already explained (2:80), (4:11). Allah clarifies the Laws so that you might not go astray. Allah is the Knower of all things"

Do not violate the symbols set up by Allah, nor the Sacred Months (2:194), nor the gifts, nor the camels for use as transport or sacrifice, nor the garlands marking them, nor the people who proceed to the Sacred Sanctuary, Ka'bah, seeking Allah's Blessings and Approval. When you have completed the Hajj, you are free to hunt. Let not your hatred of a people lead you into transgression, because they prevented you from going to the Sacred Masjid (48:25). Help one another in acts of collective benefit and in being mindful of Allah, and do not help one another in deeds that hurt humanity and in creating a wedge between people. Be mindful of Allah's Laws. His Law of Requital is strong in grasping"
