There is no secret meeting of three but He is their fourth, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of less than that or more but He is with them wherever they may be. And ultimately, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they truly accomplished. Verily, Allah is Knower of all things"

And when they come to you (O Messenger), they greet you not in the way that Allah greets you - And say to themselves, \"Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?\" Sufficient for them is Hell (in both lives) wherein they burn. And how miserable that destination is"
