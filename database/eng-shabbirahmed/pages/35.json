Say, \"Taking care of the development of their human potential, fulfilling their needs, and rearing them with good training and education is best. If they live with you, they are your brothers and sisters.\" Allah knows the person who is corrupt from the person who is equitable. Allah has bestowed upon you Guidance without which you would have carried the burdens of Ignorance. He wishes for you ease and not hardship (2:185).

            "text": "(Family is the unit of any good society. Uniformity of Ideology between the husband and the wife is important to ensure a wholesome family life). Do not marry women who associate others with Allah, till they believe. Even if such women seem attractive to you, marrying a believing woman who toils in labor and might not seem as attractive, is better for you. Nor shall you give your daughters in marriage to men who associate others with Allah, till they believe. A believing man is better than an idolater, even if you like him. Clash of basic value systems creates a fiery atmosphere in the family and it carries on to the Lasting Abode. Allah, by His Leave, invites you to Paradise and protection against your imperfections. (A happy family life is a life of paradise). He expounds His Revelations for all humanity to ponder"
