They say, \"We hear and disobey,\" and \"Your words are falling on deaf ears,\" and \"Be our shepherd,\" and they twist their tongues to mock the DEEN. It would have been better and more upright for them to say, \"We hear and obey,\" and \"We hear you,\" and \"Please watch over us and guide us.\" Instead, they have incurred deprivation from the Grace of Allah due to their denial of the Truth. Few of them will embrace belief"

Reflect and believe in what We have revealed, that confirms the truth that you already possess, lest We efface your hopes and bring them to an end.

Allah will forgive any transgression but SHIRK. Included in this category are those who worship their own desire (45:23), those who indulge in human worship and in sectarianism (30:31), (42:21), and those who follow man-made books in lieu of the Book of Allah (6:122), (6:137), and those who claim or believe in Revelation after the Qur'an, in any form, including claims of attaining Divine knowledge through mystical experience (6:62), (7:173), (7:191). And those who uphold Trinity (4:171), (5:72-73.) And those who claim that God has a son, and those who follow their religious leaders (9:31) Such people fall from the high station of humanity. Worshiping any entity other than Allah, sinks the human \"Self\" down to subhuman levels (22:31). But most of those who claim belief (and call themselves Muslims), indulge in SHIRK"

Purification of \"Self\" i.e. development of the personality can only be achieved according to the Laws of Allah, by service to humanity and not through rituals or mysticism (2:177), (13:17).
