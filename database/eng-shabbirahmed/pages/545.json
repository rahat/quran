Allah has inscribed conviction on their hearts, and has strengthened them with Energy from Himself. Hence, He will admit them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Well pleased is Allah with them, and well pleased are they with Him. They are the party of Allah. Oh, verily, it is they, the party of Allah, who are truly successful"

You deemed not that they would leave and they deemed that their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah reached them in a manner they little expected and caused awe in their hearts. So they dismantled their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the believers. Learn a lesson, then, O You who have vision"
