When death approaches you, two equitable persons among you should witness your will. If the pangs of death come upon you when you are traveling far from home, then two equitable persons other than your own people (non-Muslims) may do the witnessing. After you have prayed, let the witnesses swear by God, \"We shall not sell our word for any price, even though it is in favor of a relative, and we will not conceal what we have witnessed before God, or else we will be among the sinners"

Allah does not guide those who decide to drift away from the Straight Path"
