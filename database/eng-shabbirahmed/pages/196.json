Those who are not able to earn enough living to meet their basic needs, for any reason. Those whose running businesses have stalled or the ones who have lost their jobs, who have become needy with their active lives coming to a standstill. Officers who have been appointed by the government to collect alms and charity. Those who are hindered from joining the Divine System for financial reasons. To free men and women from bondage of any kind: physical slavery, unjust captivity, and oppression from any quarters. Those pressed under the load of ransom or heavy debt from an enemy. Defense of the Ideological State, in the Cause of Allah. The wayfarer who becomes needy, or travels to the believers in destitute condition, and the homeless son of the street. This is a Duty from Allah. He is the Knower, the Wise and His Commands are based on Knowledge and Wisdom"

He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe.\" Those who vex and hurt the Messenger of Allah, for them is an awful punishment. (The Messenger is not an emperor or a king who keep guards around them. He is accessible to all at all time and it is good for you that he pays attention to everyone)"
