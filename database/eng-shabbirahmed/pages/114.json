And grieve not about those Jews who listen only to fabricate lies. They listen and go to their folk who have never met with you. Then they distort the words out of context and tell others to accept only a part and reject a part. You can do nothing to help those who decide to go astray. Guidance and straying depend upon the Laws of Allah (4:88). Allah does not intervene to purify the hearts of such people. For those who go astray, there is disgrace in this world and an awful punishment in the Hereafter"
