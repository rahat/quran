If they come to you asking to judge among them, the choice to accept or reject their request is yours. You have the right to disclaim jurisdiction since they have not yet accepted the Qur'an and they have the Torah. If you disclaim jurisdiction they cannot harm you at all. However, if you decide to judge among them, do so equitably. Allah loves the equitable"

And the rabbis and the priests judged according to Allah's Scripture as they were commanded to observe. For to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses to it. So, fear not people, but fear Me and do not trade away My Revelations for petty gains. Whoever does not judge and rule according to what Allah has Revealed, such are the disbelievers"

If one forgoes retaliation by way of charity, it shall absolve his or her imperfections. Whoever does not judge or rule according to what Allah has Revealed, such are the wrongdoers.
