And whoever saves one life it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. Our Messengers came to people with clear Truth, yet many of them continued to transgress in the earth"

They are being slain, crucified, immobilized in great numbers, or are being entirely banished from the face of the earth. Such is their disgrace in this world, and an awful suffering awaits them in the Hereafter. (The use of present tense in this verse indicates that it is not a decree of Law. In (7:124) the use of 'qat'a' pertains to a threat in the future tense, and then it emanates from Pharaoh, tyranny personified. Only the Divine System of life can ensure peace and security in the world (2:27), (2:257), (3:147), (4:)"
