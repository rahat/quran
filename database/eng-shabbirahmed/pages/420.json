But when danger threatens, you can see them looking to you (for help, O Prophet), their eyes rolling in terror like one who is overshadowed by death. Yet once the fear has departed, they assail you believers with sharp tongues in their greed for wealth (from the spoil of war). These have never known belief, and, therefore, Allah makes all their deeds fruitless. That is easy for Allah (a spontaneous action of Allah's Law of Requital)"
