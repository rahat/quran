If you fear scarcity of trade, Allah will enrich you with His Bounty. This is the Promise of Allah who is Knower, Wise"

(As citizens of the State they must pay taxes, as the Muslims contribute toward the Just Economic Order of Zakat. In return, the State will guarantee them internal and external security, and equal rights of citizenship. JIZYA will always be less than Zakat, and will be payable only by the able-bodied Non-Muslim citizens of the State. In addition, these able-bodied citizens would be exempt from compulsory military service)"

Allah condemns them. They are surely deluded. (Some Jews in the Arabian Peninsula used to believe that Osiris, the Egyptian idol, was God's son while others thought of Ezra, who restored the Torah after it had been lost in the Babylonian Exile, as God's son)"

There is no god but He. Praise and Glory to Him, He is far too Glorious for what they ascribe to Him. (*Talmud shows the Jewish superstition of ascribing divinity to Ezra, rabbis, saints, doctors of law and learned men. And the doctrine of Papal infallibility, divinity of saints and praying to them are common in the Roman Catholic Church)"
