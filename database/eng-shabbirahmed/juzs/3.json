So they worked at diverse platforms and) Allah communicated to all of them in various ways. Jesus son of Mary was one of those Messengers to whom We gave clear signs of the Truth and We helped him with the Sacred Revelation. If Allah had created human beings like programmed robots, lacking free will, they wouldn't have differed and wouldn't fight among themselves in matters of belief. But, Allah planned that men and women be endowed with the ability to make choices, and that compulsion in matters of faith would never been ordained (2:256). Allah makes His Laws in the World of Command as He Wills, and then He implements them in the World of Creation (the Universe) and never changes His Laws ((7:54), (17)"
