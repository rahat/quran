    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Whenever you wish to confer with the Messenger by yourself, give something in charity to the needy or do an act of benevolence. That will be for your own good and cleanse the imprints of your faults on your 'Self'. But if you have no opportunity, then, behold, Allah is Absolver of faults, Merciful. (He rewards good intentions)"
