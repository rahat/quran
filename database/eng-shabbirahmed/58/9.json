    "text": "O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When you consult with one another confidentially, never consult aiming hampering progress of the community, nor in creating wedges of discord therein, and disobedience of the Messenger. But consult together for expansion of individual and social potential and seeking ways to facilitate collective right conduct. And always remain mindful of Allah unto Whom you all shall be gathered. (And all your actions end up facing His Law of Requital in both lives)"
