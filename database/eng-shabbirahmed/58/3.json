    "text": "Hence, those of you who have made senseless declarations about their wives, and then put them away into separation, and then wish to go back on their utterance - they should free a human being from bondage before the couple may 'touch' each other. This you are hereby admonished to perform. And Allah is Aware of all you do. (Freeing from bondage includes relieving someone from any kind of oppression and from a crushing burden of debt)"
