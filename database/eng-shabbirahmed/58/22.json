    "text": "You will not find those who truly believe in Allah and the Last Day endear anyone who opposes Allah and His Messenger, even though they be their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their tribe. Allah has inscribed conviction on their hearts, and has strengthened them with Energy from Himself. Hence, He will admit them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Well pleased is Allah with them, and well pleased are they with Him. They are the party of Allah. Oh, verily, it is they, the party of Allah, who are truly successful"
