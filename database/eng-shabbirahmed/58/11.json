When you are told, \"Accommodate one another in your collective life\", do accommodate, seeing that Allah will open up His resources for you. And when you are told, \"Rise up\", do rise up to the occasion. Allah will exalt to high ranks those of you who truly believe in the Divine Commands, and who use the knowledge that they have been given. For, Allah is Aware of all you do. ('Fas-h' = Open up = Make room = Accommodate others)"
