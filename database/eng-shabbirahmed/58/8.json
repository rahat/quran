    "text": "Have you not noticed those who were forbidden to conspire in secret meetings, and yet they revert to what they were forbidden, and continue to conspire together - for hampering progress, creating wedges of dissension in the society, and disobedience of the Messenger? And when they come to you (O Messenger), they greet you not in the way that Allah greets you - And say to themselves, \"Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?\" Sufficient for them is Hell (in both lives) wherein they burn. And how miserable that destination is"
