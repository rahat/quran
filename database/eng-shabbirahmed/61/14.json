    "text": "O You who have chosen to be blessed with belief! Be Allah's helpers. As an example - Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, \"Who are my helpers for Allah?\" They said, \"We are Allah's helpers.\" Thus a group from the Children of Israel accepted him, and another group rejected him. Then We strengthened those who believed, against their foe, and they became triumphant"
