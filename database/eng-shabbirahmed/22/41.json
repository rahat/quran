    "text": "Those who, if We give them power in the land, establish Salat - the Divine System - set up the Just Economic Order of Zakat (in which wealth circulates freely to nourish every member of the society, and the basic needs of all individuals are taken care of). Their rule ensures that the Divine Moral Values are promoted, and what the Qur'an forbids, is discouraged. And in their governance all affairs are decided according to Allah's decrees (in the Qur'an)"
