    "text": "And the camels! We have appointed them among the symbols (of obedience) to Allah; in them is much good for you. (They carry you and your loads and then help you host one another). So mention Allah's Name over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). And after they have fallen to the ground lifeless, eat from their flesh, and feed the contented poor who beg not as well as the poor who ask. Remember that Allah has subjected these animals to you so that you may be practically grateful"
