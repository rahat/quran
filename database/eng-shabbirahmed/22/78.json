    "text": "Strive hard in Allah's Cause, with all the striving that is due to Him. It is He Who has elected you to carry the Message and has placed no hardship in religion, the creed of your father Abraham (2:143), (2:288). It is He Who has named you Muslims in the bygone days and now in this Revelation. That the Messenger may be a witness for you, and you be witnesses for all mankind! (You shall be the watchers over peoples that no community oppresses the other). So, establish the Divine System and set up the Just Economic Order, and hold fast unto Allah. He is your Lord Supreme, and how excellent is this Giver of support"
