And they shall commemorate Allah's Name collectively during the specified days of Hajj; and over the livestock He has bestowed upon them. Then host one another with the livestock (to make the Congregation self-sufficient in the food resource). Eat and feed the distressed poor (regardless of whether they are in the congregation or elsewhere)"
