The livestock here is lawful food for you except for those already prohibited (2:173), (5:3), (6:145), (16:115). You shall avoid idol worship in any form, and abstain from bearing false witness. Avoid all things that bring your progress to a standstill. Lying, bearing false witness and flamboyant behavior are specifically forbidden at this congregation to prevent nullification of the grand objective (Rijs, Awthan, Zoor encompass all the stated meanings)"
