Clear distinction in matters of the Lawful and the Unlawful draws a tangible line between their ways and your way. Fear them not but fear Me. This Day, I have perfected your DEEN for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen for you Islam as the System of Life. (There is no hardship in Islam (2:185)).
