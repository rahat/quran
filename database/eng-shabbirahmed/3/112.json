    "text": "Humiliated are they wherever they may be, unless they grasp a bond with God, and a bond with the people. They have incurred displeasure of God, and are committed to disgrace. This is because they have been rejecting the Divine Revelations and have been opposing the Messengers of God, even wrongfully killing some of them. All this, because they rebelled, and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right"
