All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Jacob had forbidden for himself before the revelation of the Torah. And there were things that were forbidden to you as a punishment for your transgressions (4:160), (6:147). Say, \"Produce the Torah and read it to show what, in the DEEN of Abraham, was contrary to the Qur'an concerning food. Read it unto us if you are truthful"
