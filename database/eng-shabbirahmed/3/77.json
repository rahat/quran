    "text": "Those who trade away Allah's pledge and their oaths for worldly gains, will have no portion in the Hereafter. Allah shall neither speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow their \"Self\". Development of the personality can only be accomplished in this life. They have incurred a torment of suffering"
