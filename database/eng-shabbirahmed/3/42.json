    "text": "(Mary kept a spotless character as she grew up into a young lady). Angels told her, \"Allah has chosen you, given you spotless character and given you distinction among the women of your times.\" (She guarded her chastity and built a strong character in very adverse circumstances. Many monks and devotees of temples used to see the nuns with evil intentions. She was the first revolutionary feminine voice against the exploitations of monasteries)"
