    "text": "And their Lord has heard them, \"I never let the effort of any worker, male or female, go vain. Men and women are from one another, so their Recompense shall be equal. Those who emigrated, or were driven out of their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and fought and were slain, I shall blot their inequities. The imprints of their misdeeds on their \"Self\" will be erased. I shall admit them into Gardens with rivulets flowing beneath.\" A Reward from Allah. And with Allah is the best Reward"
