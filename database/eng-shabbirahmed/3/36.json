    "text": "When she was delivered she said, \"My Lord! I am delivered of a female.\" Allah knew best what she delivered; the male is not the same as the female. (The male she had prayed for could have not been like the outstanding daughter she was granted). \"I have named her Mary, I request Your protection for her and for her descendants from the rejected Satan.\" (Allah knew that this female would have a role, which no male could have, in breaking the shackles of asceticism. As a custom, nuns were allowed to marry only monks during those times)"
