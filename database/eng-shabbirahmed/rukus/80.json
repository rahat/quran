Moreover, they are the custodians of the future generations like a garden that bears flowery plants (2:223)) They ask you to enlighten them further about the Laws concerning women (O Prophet). Say, \"Allah Himself enlightens you about the Laws concerning them, and the Book which has been recited to you conveys the decree. (You shall be especially kind to women who are widowed, orphaned, or left helpless for any reason (2:83), (2:215), (4:3), (2:240), (8:41)) You shall restore the rights of the orphaned women to whom you give not what is ordained (their due marital gifts) when you wish to marry them. And Allah decrees about helpless children, and your duty to treat orphans in a most kind manner. And whatever good you may do, behold, Allah is ever Aware"
