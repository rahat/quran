Neither kill your children for fear of poverty nor deprive them of proper training and education. We provide for you and for them. (The Divine System will take care of your needs and their needs). Do not go near immodesty or lewdness whether openly or in secret. Do not slay a life, life that Allah has made sacred except in the course of justice. This He has commanded you so that you use reason and obey these Commands"

We do not assign any \"Self\" responsibility beyond its means. And when you voice an opinion, be just, even if it is against a relative.
