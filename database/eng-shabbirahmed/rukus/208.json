As for the rejecters of the Divine Laws, disasters will not cease to strike them for their deeds, even close to their homes until the Promise of Allah comes to pass.

Those systems will keep collapsing and they will keep suffering far and close to their homes. Then, ultimately, they will realize that the Qur'an offers the solutions to all the problems facing humanity (41:53)"
