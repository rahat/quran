Whoever kills it intentionally, must send a Permissible domestic animal to the Ka'bah, as a gift for the needy. Two equitable persons will decide what domestic animal is equivalent to the game animal that was killed. They must ensure that the offering reaches the Ka'bah (for use by the needy pilgrims (22:28)). Or for expiation, feed some poor persons at a cost equal to the cost of the animal. If someone has no means to do that, then Abstinence (for three days as in Ramadan. Three days of Abstinence would equal feeding ten poor persons (5:89). Allah has pardoned past violations. An appropriate court shall punish those who persist in violating this Law. Allah is Almighty, Able to requite"
