And Moses asked for water for his people, We said, \"Smite the rock with your staff.\" (We guided him to rocks under which were hidden twelve springs of water ready to gush forth. Moses, with the strength of his conviction and with the help of his companions, unclogged those springs) And there gushed out twelve springs so that each of the twelve tribes found their respective source of fresh cool water. Moses said, \"Eat and drink of what Allah has provided, and desist from creating inequity and disorder in the land"

They did all this, because they chose to rebel against the Divine Commands, and crossed the moral bounds"
