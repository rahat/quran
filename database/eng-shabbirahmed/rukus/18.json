(It will be your sacred duty to ensure that no people on earth will oppress others). So far as the transformation of the Center of devotion is concerned, it has distinguished between those who succumb to traditional and nationalistic preferences from those who see all mankind as one nation and follow the Messenger. And the Messenger is fulfilling Allah's Command for the Unity of Mankind. In fact it was a hard test except for those who have attained Allah's Guidance. Allah never lets your Faith go in vain. Verily, Allah is Compassionate and Merciful to all mankind"

Soon, you will happily administer the Sacred Masjid that is dear to you for its Sublime objective. Wherever each of you is, keep your focus on it as a symbol of pure Monotheism, and of your Ideological uniformity. Behold, those who have been given the Scripture know that your call is the Truth from their Lord. (They remain bent upon denial for blind following, prejudice and arrogance).
