Abraham said to him, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" (Being a tyrant king he could reverse or impose death penalty upon his subjects). Abraham said, \"Allah makes the sun rise from the East; make it rise from the West.\" Thereupon the rejecter of the Truth remained dumbfounded. And Allah does not guide people who displace reality with falsehood"

He thinks it was only a matter of a day or a part of it. He even finds his food, drink, and donkey standing beside him. Allah creates you in the wombs of your mothers, in bone and flesh.

Abraham said he believed but that he wanted a practical example to educate his heart and mind. Allah told him to take four birds and train them in a kind manner, and then to leave them far apart on each hilltop. And then call them; they will come in haste. (At one call of Abraham, those birds came flying back to him. This is how mankind can be brought to the Word of Allah with decent training, giving them a new life). Know that this Wisdom comes to you from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise"
