Say, \"They should serve as signs to mark certain timings for people. And for Hajj.\" (Misconceptions and superstitions about the sun and the moon have nothing to do with righteousness). You attain righteousness by upholding the Commands in a straightforward manner. Exponential development of humanity cannot be achieved by entering the System through the back door of ritualism - just as you must not enter houses through the back doors (2:177). (Since there is no such thing as a part-time Muslim) you shall be mindful of Allah all the time in order to reap a rich harvest. ((2:)"

For, oppression, cruelty and persecution are even more severely destructive than the killing in battle. And fight not against them near the Sacred House that is a Symbol of unified submission of all mankind to their Creator, unless they attack you therein. But if they attack you there, then fight against them. Such is the reward of those who refuse to acknowledge and then violate the sanctity of the Sanctuary of Peace for all humanity. (The Sacred Masjid in Makkah must be a safe Sanctuary and a source of peace and security for all mankind (2:144-148), (3:96), (5:2), (5:97), (9:18), (22:25-28), (40:19), (48:25).

Do not consider that by doing so you have relieved yourself of the burden of the duty from your head. Be with them at heart until all reach the destination. If someone is sick or has other compelling burdens on the head denying him sending the gifts, then Abstinence for a few days at convenience, or an act of charity or fulfilling someone's need shall be in order. If a person is present in the congregation but cannot afford gift sharing, one should exercise Abstinence for a total number of ten days, three days there and seven days after coming home. This is for him whose folk are not present in the Sacred Masjid (Makkah in the wider sense). This will help him feel no less devoted than others. Follow the Guidance of Allah. Remember the higher goal and be mindful of Allah. And know that Allah's Law of Requital is strict in pursuing and grasping"
