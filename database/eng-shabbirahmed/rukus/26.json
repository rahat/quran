Whoever participates in Pilgrimage shall refrain from intimate husband-wife relationship, misconduct and arguments throughout Hajj so that mutual consultation could take place in an amicable environment. Allah will acknowledge what you accomplish for the good of mankind. And do make provision for the entire number of days so that you don't have to ask people for help, rather be able to help them. But remember that the most important and best provision is your good conduct. Be mindful of Me, O Men and women of understanding"
