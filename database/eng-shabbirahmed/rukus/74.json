            "text": "It is not conceivable that a believer will slay another believer unless it be a mistake. If one kills a believer by mistake, there is the duty of freeing a believing person from bondage; may it be slavery, extreme poverty, crushing debt or oppression. And pay compensation to the victim's family unless they forgo it by way of charity. If case the victim was a believer, and belonged to a tribe who are at war with you, free a believing person from bondage. If the victim was a believer, and belonged to a tribe with whom you have a peace treaty, you should pay the compensation to his family in addition to freeing a believing person from bondage. For those who find this settlement beyond their means, two consecutive months of Abstinence, as in the month of Ramadan, are ordained by way of repentance from Allah. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise"

His requital shall be Hell, therein to abide, and Allah will condemn him, and reject him and prepare for him awesome suffering. (Unjust killing of any human being, regardless of color, creed, religion or sex is a grievous offense that is tantamount to slaying the entire humankind (5:32). Hence, the offender shall be punished accordingly. Intentional murder of any human being is also a crime against the State, therefore, the State would be responsible for tracing, arresting and trying the offender in a court of law. QISAS = the duty of tracing an offender for just recompense"

And do not say, out of a desire for the fleeting gains of this worldly life, to anyone who offers you the greeting of peace, \"You are not a believer.\" For with Allah are abundant gains. Remember, once you were ignorant, and you were weak like the disbelievers are now. Allah has been Gracious to you, so be gracious to His servants (9:128), (90:17). Use your discernment. Allah is always Aware of what you do"
