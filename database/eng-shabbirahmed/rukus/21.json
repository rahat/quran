In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, the ships that roam the ocean for the benefit of mankind, the water that Allah sends down from the heights, thereby giving life to the land after it had been lifeless - and the variety of creatures that are dispersed on the earth, the currents of winds and the clouds they carry at various heights, are clear Signs for those who exercise their intellect. (The Universe is too organized to be the result of an accident)"

But the true believers revere Allah more than all else. (7:3). Oh, that those who relegate the Truth could but see, as see they will when they are made to suffer! They will realize that all Power belongs to Allah alone and that Allah is Awesome in punishing. (Reverence or love of Allah, in the Qur'an, invariably denotes obeying His Commands)"
