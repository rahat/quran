But in time they turn into dry stubble or hay which the winds blow freely about. Allah is Competent and all events take place according to His Laws over which He has full control. (Total preoccupation with the material aspects of life deprives people from growing in humanity)"

Those who were used to stealing the fruit of others' labor will be scared. They will say, \"Oh, woe unto us! What kind of a Book is this! It leaves out nothing, be it small or great, but takes everything into account!\" In the Divine System every deed, small or big will come forth (53:39-40). Universal Justice will prevail since your Lord does not wrong anyone. (This verse applies to the Hereafter as well in the form of the Divine Record Book, just as Hell and Paradise are frequently mentioned in the Qur'an applying to both lives)"
