Then they distort the words out of context and tell others to accept only a part and reject a part. You can do nothing to help those who decide to go astray. Guidance and straying depend upon the Laws of Allah (4:88). Allah does not intervene to purify the hearts of such people. For those who go astray, there is disgrace in this world and an awful punishment in the Hereafter"
