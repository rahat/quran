The reverence of the people took a turn). Some people said, \"Erect a building in their memory. God knows best their true stature.\" Others, whose opinion prevailed, said, \"Indeed, we must raise a house of worship in their memory.\" The building in which they would submit to the One True God, like a Masjid.
