The believers will assemble in the Masjid for prayer, and to address social welfare and community action). O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Join not the Salat congregation if your mind is beclouded for any reason, until you understand what you utter, else you might say senseless words that disturb the assembly. Physical cleanliness contributes to moral purity. So, take a bath after ceremonial impurity. If you are traveling, or are ill, or coming from the privy, and cannot find water, take a little clean sand or earth and lightly rub your faces and hands, before entering the Masjid. (This will help you prepare psychologically for the assembly (5:6)). Allah pardons and absolves your imperfections"

They say, \"We hear and disobey,\" and \"Your words are falling on deaf ears,\" and \"Be our shepherd,\" and they twist their tongues to mock the DEEN. It would have been better and more upright for them to say, \"We hear and obey,\" and \"We hear you,\" and \"Please watch over us and guide us.\" Instead, they have incurred deprivation from the Grace of Allah due to their denial of the Truth. Few of them will embrace belief"

Allah will forgive any transgression but SHIRK. Included in this category are those who worship their own desire (45:23), those who indulge in human worship and in sectarianism (30:31), (42:21), and those who follow man-made books in lieu of the Book of Allah (6:122), (6:137), and those who claim or believe in Revelation after the Qur'an, in any form, including claims of attaining Divine knowledge through mystical experience (6:62), (7:173), (7:191). And those who uphold Trinity (4:171), (5:72-73.) And those who claim that God has a son, and those who follow their religious leaders (9:31) Such people fall from the high station of humanity. Worshiping any entity other than Allah, sinks the human \"Self\" down to subhuman levels (22:31). But most of those who claim belief (and call themselves Muslims), indulge in SHIRK"
