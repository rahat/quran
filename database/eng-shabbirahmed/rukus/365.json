You seek to conceal in your heart what Allah intends to reveal. You are afraid of people whereas it is more appropriate to fear Allah.\" But when Zayd had observed all the rules and divorced her, We gave her to you in marriage. So that henceforth there may be no blame on the believers in respect of spouses of their adopted children when they have come to the dissolution of their union. And the Commandment of Allah must be fulfilled. (Contrary to many erroneous translations, the entire quote in this verse is addressed to Zayd since Messengers fear none but Allah (33:39). Also the admonition of the Prophet to Zayd clearly indicates that he, and not his wife, was at fault"
