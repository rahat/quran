Do you extend love and friendship to them when they reject the Truth that has come to you, driving out the Messenger and you because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If you are committed to strive in My Way and to seek My Approval, befriend them not. Do you show them friendship in secret, when I am best Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal? And whoever among you does that, he has certainly strayed from the right way"

In You we place our trust, unto You we turn, and unto You is the Final Destination. (9:113), (14:41), (19:47), (3)"
