Let your servants and children who have not yet come of age ask your permission before coming in to see you on three occasions: Before you engage in your assignments at dawn, at noon when you are resting with light clothes, and after you have completed your assignments at night. These are your three times of privacy. At other times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about freely, attending to one another. In this way, Allah makes clear to you the revelations, for, Allah is All Knowing, Wise"

There is no blame on the blind, nor is there blame on the crippled, nor there is blame on the sick or handicapped, to eat from your houses. Just as there is no blame on you for eating at your own homes, or your fathers' homes, or your mothers' homes, or your brothers' homes, or your sisters' homes, or your paternal uncles' homes, or your paternal aunts' homes, or your maternal uncles' homes, or your maternal aunts' homes, or the homes you manage and hold the keys of, or the home of a friend. You do nothing wrong by dining together or apart. But whenever you enter houses, salute one another with a blessed, goodly greeting from Allah. Thus Allah makes clear the revelations for you, so that you may understand (the goodness in them)"
