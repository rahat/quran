Whatever you take as spoils of war, a fifth of that is for Allah and for the Messenger (the Central Authority, to run the government). The rest will belong to the families of soldiers who laid their lives defending the State, the orphans, those left alone in the society, the widows, the ones whose income has stalled for any reason, the needy wayfarer, and whoever travels to the believers in a destitute condition. This is if you believe in Allah and in what We revealed to Our servant when the two armies met (at Badr) on the Day of Distinction. Allah is the Appointer of due measure for all things"
