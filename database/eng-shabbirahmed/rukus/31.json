If the father dies, his heir will assume these responsibilities. If both parents decide with mutual consent, there shall be nothing wrong in entrusting your children to foster-mothers. You shall mutually ensure, in a fair manner, the safety of the child you are handing over. Be mindful of Allah's Laws and know that Allah is Seer of all that you do"

But, never make a secret pledge or contract with them. Speak with them honorably and in recognized words. Do not tie the wedding knot nor sign the martial contract until the waiting period has ended. Know that Allah understands human psyche, and that which is in your hearts. Take heed of Him and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement. He does not wish to impose hardship on you. His Laws protect your society from harm by absolving your imperfections. (Allah, the Clement never gets enraged and His Rule is the Rule of Law)"
