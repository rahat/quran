    "text": "On that Day We shall roll up the Sky as a written scroll is rolled up. Then, just as We initiated the first Creation, We shall create a new Universe. This is a Promise incumbent upon Us. Truly We shall fulfill it. (The earth will see a new Dawn. Top leaders, tyrants, and tycoons of wealth will lose their high empires of influence. It will be a whole new life for the inhabitants of the earth, united one community as they were once (2:213), (10:19), (14)"
