Trade is the return on labor that is permissible (53:39), while usury is the return on money. That is why Allah, in His Infinite Wisdom, has permitted trade and forbidden usury. One to whom the clear Admonition has come from his Sustainer, must abstain from taking usury forthwith. What he has taken in the past, he may keep and his judgment rests with Allah. (It is better for him to return the interest he has earned if possible, but the law shall not force him to do so). As for him who returns to usury, such are the rightful companions of the Fire to abide therein. (Satan=Serpent)"

No scribe shall decline to perform this duty, and write as Allah has taught him. The debtor, or in case he or she is incompetent, his representative shall dictate the document honestly and be mindful of his Lord, and diminish not the amount. There shall be two men among you to witness the transaction. If two men are not available, let there be one man and two women as witnesses. All witnesses should be such that their testimony is acceptable to all. The second woman will not be a witness in the court of law. She is there only to remind the first woman if she forgets. It is the obligation of the witnesses to testify when called upon to do so. Do not tire of writing the details, no matter how long, including the time of repayment. This is equitable in the Sight of Allah, assures better witnessing, and eliminates any doubts you may have. When it is actual merchandise that you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand, there is nothing wrong for you if you write it not, but have it witnessed. The scribe and the witnesses must be held harmless for their services. If you harm them, it would be wickedness on your part. If you follow Allah's Commands He will increase you in knowledge. These are the Injunctions of Allah Who is the Knower of all things; intentions, events and actions"
