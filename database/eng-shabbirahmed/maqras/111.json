People usually do that to advance from others wrongfully, or help their own groups (57:20). Allah has devised this as a test of your character. (Human beings are the only creatures who can make a pledge. Breaking promises violates human rights and hurts your own \"Self\"). On The Day of Resurrection you will appear before your Lord with the imprints of your doings on your \"Self\".
