(Men and women of intellect know that abstract phenomena are frequently well defined and understood in that manner). Since the believers exercise reason, (they appreciate this beauty of the Divine Wisdom and) they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. On the other hand, those who have chosen to disbelieve, try to ridicule by saying, \"What could Allah mean to teach by this similitude?\" Thus His Law of guidance lets go astray many and shows the Way to many. (But note) He never lets go astray except those who drift away from Reason"
