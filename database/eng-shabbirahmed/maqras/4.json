And Moses asked for water for his people, We said, \"Smite the rock with your staff.\" (We guided him to rocks under which were hidden twelve springs of water ready to gush forth. Moses, with the strength of his conviction and with the help of his companions, unclogged those springs) And there gushed out twelve springs so that each of the twelve tribes found their respective source of fresh cool water. Moses said, \"Eat and drink of what Allah has provided, and desist from creating inequity and disorder in the land"

We are weary of the same kind of food, so ask your Lord that He brings forth for us plant food such as herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions.\" He said, \"Would you exchange superior for the inferior? (Preoccupy yourselves with petty desires instead of higher goals). Go back in shame to Egypt and you will get what you demand.\" So humiliation and misery were stamped upon them and they had to face the Divine Requital. That was because they kept denying the Messages of Allah. And in the past they had opposed and even killed some Prophets in their transgression. They did all this, because they chose to rebel against the Divine Commands, and crossed the moral bounds"
