Do not marry women who associate others with Allah, till they believe. Even if such women seem attractive to you, marrying a believing woman who toils in labor and might not seem as attractive, is better for you. Nor shall you give your daughters in marriage to men who associate others with Allah, till they believe. A believing man is better than an idolater, even if you like him. Clash of basic value systems creates a fiery atmosphere in the family and it carries on to the Lasting Abode. Allah, by His Leave, invites you to Paradise and protection against your imperfections.
