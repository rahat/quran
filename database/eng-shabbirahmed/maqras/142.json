The example of His Light (the Qur'an) is that of a lamp that is placed inside a niche enclosed in glass that shines like a radiant star. This lamp is kindled from a blessed tree - olive - neither of the East nor of the West. Its Light issues forth in all directions. The oil glows by itself even though no fire has touched it. Light upon Light. Allah guides to His Light anyone who seeks guidance. And Allah sets forth allegories for mankind. And Allah does know all things (and how to make you understand that light needs no aid to show itself (20)"
