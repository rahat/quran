    "text": "It is He who is standing upon every soul for what it has earned; yet they set up partners with God. Say: \"Name them?\" Or are you informing Him of what He does not know on the earth or is it just a show of words? Indeed, to the rejecters, their scheming is made to appear pleasing, and they are repelled from the path. And whoever God misguides will have no guide"
