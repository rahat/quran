    "text": "O you who believe, be supporters of God, as Jesus, son of Mary, said to his disciples: \"Who are my supporters towards God?\" The disciples said: \"We are supporters of God.\" Thus, a group from the Children of Israel believed, and another group rejected. So We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they were successful"
