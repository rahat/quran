    "text": "Did you not see those who were told: \"Cease your aggression, and hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification.\" But when fighting was decreed for them, a group of them were concerned towards the people as they would have been concerned towards God or even more so. And they said: \"Our Lord, why did You decree fighting for us? If only You would delay for us until another time.\" Say: \"The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is far better for those who are aware; you will not be wronged in the least"
