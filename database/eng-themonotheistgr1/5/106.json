    "text": "O you who believe, witnessing shall be done if death is approaching one of you and a will is being made, by two among you who are equitable. If you have gone forth in the land, and death is approaching, then any two may suffice - if you have doubt regarding them, then detain them after making the contact prayer, and they will swear by God: \"We will not purchase with it any price, even if it was from a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of God, else we are of the sinners"
