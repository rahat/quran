    "text": "You may postpone whom you will of them, and you may receive whom you will. And whomsoever you seek of those whom you have set aside then there is no sin upon you. Such is best that they may be comforted and not grieve, and that they may all be pleased with what you give them. And God knows what is in your hearts. And God is Knowledgeable, Compassionate"
