    "text": "Those who consume usury do not rise except as one being influenced by the touch of the devil. That is because they have said: \"Trade is the same as usury.\" While God has made trade lawful, and He has made usury unlawful. Whoever has received understanding from His Lord and ceases, then he will be forgiven for what was before this and his case will be with God. But whoever returns, then they are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide"
