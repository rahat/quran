    "text": "That your sister should follow, and say: 'Shall I guide you to a person who will nurse him.' Thus We returned you to your mother, so that she may be pleased and not be sad. And you killed a person, but We saved you from harm and We tested you greatly. So it was that you stayed with the people of Midyan for many years, then you came here by fate O Moses"
