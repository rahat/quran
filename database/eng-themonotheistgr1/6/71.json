    "text": "Say: \"Shall we call upon other than God what cannot benefit us or harm us, and we turn back on our heels after God has guided us?\" This is like the one whom the devils have managed to mislead on the earth, he is confused, having friends who call him to the guidance: \"Come to us!\" Say: \"The guidance is the guidance of God, and we have been ordered to submit to the Lord of the worlds"
