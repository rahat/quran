    "text": "Or you say: \"If the Book was sent to us we would have been more guided than they!\" Clarity has come to you from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who is more wicked than he who denies the revelations of God and turns away from them? We will punish those who turn away from Our revelations with the pain of retribution for what they turned away"
