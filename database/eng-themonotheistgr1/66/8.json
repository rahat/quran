    "text": "O you who believe, you shall repent to God a sincere repentance. It may be that your Lord will forgive your sins and admit you into estates with rivers flowing beneath them. On that Day, God will not disappoint the prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will radiate around them and to their right. They will say: \"Our Lord, keep perfect our light for us, and forgive us; You are able to do all things"
