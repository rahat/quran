And had God wished, the people after them would not have fought after the proofs had come to them, but they disputed, some of them believed and some of them rejected. If God had wished they would not have fought, but God does what He pleases"

His Throne encompasses all of the heavens and the earth and it is easy for Him to preserve them. He is the Most High, the Great"
