    "text": "Have you noted those who were prohibited from holding meetings in secret, but then they go back to what they have been prohibited from? They meet secretly to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience of the messenger. When they come to you, they greet you with a greeting other than that which God greets you with. They say inside themselves: \"Why does God not punish us for our utterances?\" Hell will be sufficient for them, wherein they burn; what a miserable destiny"
