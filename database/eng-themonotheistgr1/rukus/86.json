And help each other in piety and righteousness, and do not help each other in sin and aggression. And be aware of God, for the retribution of God is severe"

This is vile. Today the rejecters have given up from your system, so do not be concerned by them, but be concerned by Me. Today I have perfected your system for you, and completed My blessings upon you, and I have approved submission as the system for you. So, whoever is forced by severe hunger and not seeking sin, then God is Forgiving, Merciful"
