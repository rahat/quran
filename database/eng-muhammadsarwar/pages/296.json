They started to argue with each other about the matter (Resurrection) and some of them said, \"Let us establish a building at the youths' sleeping place (to hide them). Their Lord knew best their intentions about them. The majority prevailed in their suggestion of the establishment of a mosque in that place"

Still some of them say, \"There were seven and the dog was the eighth one.\" (Muhammad), say, \"My Lord has the best knowledge of their number.
