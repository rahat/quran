Abraham said, \"It is only my Lord who gives life and causes things to die.\" His opponent said, \"I also can give life and make things die.\" Abraham said, \"God causes the sun to come up from the East. You make it come from the West.\" Thus the unbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the unjust people"
