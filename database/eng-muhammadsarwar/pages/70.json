To some others of you, your lives were so important that you, like ignorant people, began thinking suspiciously of God saying, \"Do we have any say in the matter?\" (Muhammad), tell them, \"All matters belong to God.\" They try to hide within their souls what they do not reveal to you. They say, \"Had we had the matter in our hands, we would not have been killed there.\" Tell them, \"Even if you had stayed in your own homes, your sworn enemies could have attacked you and slain you while you were in your beds. God wanted to test you and purge what existed in your hearts"

It is God who gives life and causes people to die. God is Well Aware of what you do"
