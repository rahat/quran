Is light equal to darkness?\" Do they consider that their idols have created anything like that of God, thus, both creations appear to them to be alike?\" Say, \"God alone is the Creator of all things and He is the One, the All-Dominant"

This is similar to that foam which rises when you expose something to the heat of a fire to manufacture ornaments or for other reasons. To God Truth and falsehood are like these examples. The foam disappears but what is profitable to the human being stays in the land. Thus, does God coin His parables"
