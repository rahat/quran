    "text": "(Can anyone be considered equal to) the One who is the Guardian of every soul and the Watcher of what it has gained? Yet, the unbelievers have considered their idols equal to God. Say, \"Name the attributes of your idols. Are you trying to tell God about something that does not exist on the earth? Do you only mention empty names?
