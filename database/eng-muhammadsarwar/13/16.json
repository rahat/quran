    "text": "(Muhammad), ask them, \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"It is God.\" Ask them, \"Why then have you taken guardians other than God when such guardians can neither benefit nor harm themselves?\" Ask them, \"Are the seeing and the blind equal? Is light equal to darkness?\" Do they consider that their idols have created anything like that of God, thus, both creations appear to them to be alike?\" Say, \"God alone is the Creator of all things and He is the One, the All-Dominant"
