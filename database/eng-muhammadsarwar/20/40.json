    "text": "Your sister went to them and said, \"May I show you someone who will nurse this child?\" We returned you to your mother to make her rejoice and forget her grief. You slew a man and We saved you from trouble. We tried you through various trials. Then you stayed some years with the people of Midian (Shu'ayb and his family) and after that you came back to Egypt as was ordained"
