    "text": "(Or have you heard) of the one who, on passing through an empty and ruined town, said, \"When will God bring it to life?\" God caused him to die and brought him back to life after a hundred years and then asked him, \"How long have you been here?\" He replied, \"One day or part of a day.\" The Lord said, \"No, you have been here for one hundred years. Look at your food and drink. They have not yet decayed. But look at your donkey and its bones. To make your case evidence (of the Truth) for the people, see how we bring the bones together and cover them with flesh.\" When he learned the whole story, he said, \"Now I know that God has power over all things"
