    "text": "When you demanded Moses to provide you with a variety of food, saying, \"We no longer have patience with only one kind of food, ask your Lord to grow green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, and onions for us,\" Moses replied, \"Would you change what is good for what is worse? Go to any town and you will get what you want.\" Despised and afflicted with destitution, they brought the wrath of God back upon themselves, for they denied the evidence (of the existence of God) and murdered His Prophets without reason; they were disobedient transgressors"
