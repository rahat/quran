    "text": "When Saul set forth with the army he said, \"God will test you with a river. Those who drink its water will not be of my people and those who do not even taste the water or who only taste some of it from within the hollow of their hand, will be my friends. They all drank the water except a few of them. When Saul and those who believed in him crossed the river, his people said, \"We do not have the strength to fight against Goliath and his army.\" Those who thought that they would meet God said, \"How often, with God's permission, have small groups defeated the large ones?\" God is with those who exercise patience"
