    "text": "Have you not seen those who have been forbidden to have secret counsels violate this prohibition and resume their secret counsels for sinful and hostile purposes and to disobey the Messenger? When they come to you (Muhammad), they greet you with a greeting with which even God has not greeted you and say to themselves, \"Why has God not punished us for what we say (if he is a true Prophet)?\" The heat of hell is a sufficient torment for them. This is the most terrible fate"
