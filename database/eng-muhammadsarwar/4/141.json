If God grants you victory, they say, \"Did we not help you?\" If the unbelievers are victorious, they say, \"Did we not encourage you not to surrender to the believers and did we not protect you from them?\" God will judge among you on the Day of Judgment. He will never help the disbelievers against the believers"
