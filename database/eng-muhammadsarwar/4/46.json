    "text": "Some Jews take certain words out of context and by twisting their tongues to make a jest out of the true religion, say, \"We heard and (in our hearts) disobeyed. (Muhammad) ra`ina (be kind to us) but they intend thereby (the meaning in their own language): \"Listen! May God turn you deaf.\" They should have said, \"We heard and obeyed. (Muhammad) listen and consider our question.\" This would have been better for them and more righteous. God has condemned them for their disbelief, thus, no one, except a few among them, will have faith"
