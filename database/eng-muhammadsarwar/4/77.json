    "text": "Have you not seen those who were told to stop fighting, to say their prayers, and pay the religious tax? When they were ordered to fight, some of them feared other men as much as or more than they feared God and so they said, \"Lord, why have you ordered us to fight? If only you would give us a little time.\" (Muhammad), tell them, \"The pleasures of the worldly life are trivial. The life hereafter is best for the pious ones. You will not be treated the slightest bit unjustly"
