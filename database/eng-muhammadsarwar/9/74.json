    "text": "They (the hypocrites) swear by the Name of God (to make others believe in what they are saying). They have spoken the testimony of disbelief and have then turned back to disbelief. They have made unsuccessful attempts to cause trouble. There is no other reason for their ungratefulness except that God and His Messenger enriched them through their favors. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away (from the faith), God will make them suffer a painful punishment both in this life and in the life hereafter. They will find no guardian nor any helper in the land"
