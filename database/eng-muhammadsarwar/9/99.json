    "text": "Some of the desert dwelling Arabs believe in God and the Day of Judgment. Whatever they spend for the cause of God they consider it as a means of getting nearer to God and have the prayers of the Messenger in their favor. This, certainly is a means to get nearer to God. God will admit them into His mercy. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
