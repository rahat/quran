When the unbelievers expelled him and he was one of the two people in the cave telling his friend, \"Do not worry; God is with us,\" then God gave him confidence and supported him with an army which you did not see and He defeated the cause of the disbelievers and made His own cause stand supreme. God is Majestic and All-wise"
