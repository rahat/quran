    "text": "God also forgave the three people who lagged behind. Grief made them feel as though there was no place in the whole vast earth to hide them or in their souls to conceal their sorrow. They began to believe that no one could save them from (the wrath of God) except He Himself. God pardoned them so that they would also repent for their sins. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
