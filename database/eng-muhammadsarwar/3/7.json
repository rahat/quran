Those whose hearts are perverse, follow the unclear statements in pursuit of their own mischievous goals by interpreting them in a way that will suit their own purpose. No one knows its true interpretations except God and those who have a firm grounding in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All its verses are from our Lord.\" No one can grasp this fact except the people of reason"
