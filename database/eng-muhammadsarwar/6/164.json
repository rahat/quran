    "text": "(Muhammad), tell them, \"Should I take a lord besides God when He is the Lord of all things?\" All one's evil deeds are against one's own soul. No one will be considered responsible for another's sins. You will all be returned to your Lord who will tell you what is right and wrong in disputed matters among you"
