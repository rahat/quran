    "text": "It is He who has created all kinds of gardens, those raised on trellises and those without, palm-trees and the crops of different seasons, and olives and pomegranates of all types. You may eat their fruits that they produce but pay God's share on the harvest day. Do not be excessive for God does not love those who are excessive"
