    "text": "Believers, do not choose My enemies and your own enemies for friends, and offer them strong love. They have rejected the Truth which has come to you, and have expelled the Messenger and you from your homes because of your belief in your Lord. When you go to fight for My cause and seek My pleasure, you secretly express your love of them. I know best what you reveal or conceal. Whichever of you does this has indeed gone astray from the right path"
