    "text": "Believers, when believing immigrant women come to you, test them. God knows best about their faith. If you know that they are believers, do not return them to the disbelievers. Such women are not lawful for them and disbelievers are not lawful for such women. Give the disbelievers whatever they have spent (on such women for their dowry). There is no offense for you to marry them if you agree to give them their dowry. Do not hold unto your disbelieving wives; you may get back what you have spent on them for their dowry and the disbelievers may also ask for what they have spent. This is the command of God by which He judges you. God is All-knowing and All-wise"
