    "text": "Those who have said that the Messiah, son of Mary, is God, have, in fact, committed themselves to disbelief. (Muhammad), ask them, \"Who can prevent God from destroying the Messiah, his mother and all that is in the earth?\" To God belongs all that is in the heavens, the earth, and all that is between them. God creates whatever He wants and He has power over all things"
