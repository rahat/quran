If you have any doubts as to their honesty, detain them and let them take an oath after the prayer, each one of them saying, \"I swear by God that my testimony is true. I am not selling the Truth for a paltry price even though the beneficiary would be one of my relatives. I do not hide the testimony which is the right of God, for then I would be one of the sinners"
