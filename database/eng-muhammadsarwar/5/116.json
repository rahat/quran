    "text": "When God asked Jesus, son of Mary \"Did you tell men to consider you and your mother as their gods besides God?\" he replied, \"Glory be to you! How could I say what I have no right to say? Had I ever said it, You would have certainly known about it. You know what is in my soul, but I do not know what is in Yours. It is You who has absolute knowledge of the unseen"
