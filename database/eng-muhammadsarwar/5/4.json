    "text": "(Muhammad), they ask you what has been made lawful for them (as food). Tell them, \"All pure things are made lawful for you.\" If you train dogs or other beasts for hunting, you should train them according to what God has taught you. It, then, is lawful for you to eat the animals that they hunt, provided you mention the Name of God over the prey. Have fear of God. Certainly God's reckoning is swift"
