    "text": "You may refuse whichever (of the woman who offer themselves to you) as you want and accept whichever of them you wish. There is no blame on you if you marry (one whom you had refused previously). This would be more delightful for them. They should not be grieved but should be happy with whatever you have given to every one of them. God knows what is in your hearts. God is All-knowing and All-forbearing"
