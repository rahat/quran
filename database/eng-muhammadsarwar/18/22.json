    "text": "(With regard to the number of the youths) some say, \"There were three and the dog was the fourth one,\" Others say, \"There were five and the dog was the sixth one.\" In reality, they are just feeling around in the dark. Still some of them say, \"There were seven and the dog was the eighth one.\" (Muhammad), say, \"My Lord has the best knowledge of their number. You know very little about it.\" Do not insist on arguing with them, but merely tell them the story as it has been revealed to you and do not ask anyone about them"
