    "text": "During the appointment, the Lord spoke to Moses. He asked the Lord to show Himself so that he could look at Him. The Lord replied, \"You can never see Me. But look at the mountain. If the mountain remains firm only then will you see Me.\" When the Lord manifested His Glory to the mountain, He turned it into dust and Moses fell down upon his face senseless. After regaining his senses, Moses said, \"Lord, You are all Holy. I repent for what I asked you to do and I am the first to believe in You"
