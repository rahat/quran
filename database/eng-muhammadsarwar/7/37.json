These will have their share (of torment) which is ordained for them and when Our (angelic) Messengers come to them to cause them to die and ask them, \"Where are those whom you had been worshipping besides God?\" they will reply, \"We had gone astray from the path of God.\" Thus, they will testify against their own souls by confessing their disbelief"
