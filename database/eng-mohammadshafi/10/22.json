    "text": "He it is Who facilitates your movement by land and sea and you get into the ship. And the ship sails on with a pleasant breeze blowing and with people rejoicing the ride, until a violent wind overtakes them and the billows surge in on them from all sides, and they become certain that they are engulfed therein. They then pray to Allah in all sincerity and obedience to Him, \"If You do deliver us from this, we will most certainly be grateful"
