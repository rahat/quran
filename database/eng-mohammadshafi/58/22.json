    "text": "You will not find any community, believing in Allah and the Last Day, loving those who work against Allah and His Messenger, even though they be their fathers or their sons or their brethren or their [other] relatives. That [community] is such that He has decreed Faith in their minds and has strengthened them with a Spirit from Him. And He will admit them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. Those are the ones in Allah's Party. Is it not members of Allah's Party that indeed are successful"
