    "text": "And strive in Allah's way, as one ought to strive in His way. HE has chosen you [the pronoun is in plural] and has not laid upon you any severity in following the way of life approved by Him for you â€” the lifestyle of your forefather Abraham. HE named you as the Muslims before and in this (Qur'aan), so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and you may be witnesses over mankind. Hence, pray to Allah regularly and properly, give charity and hold fast unto Him! HE is your Guardian. How excellent the Guardian, and how excellent the Supporter!h"
