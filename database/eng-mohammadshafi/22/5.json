    "text": "O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then — to make things clear to you — We did indeed create you from dust, then from a little seed of fertilized ovum, then from a leech-like clinging clot of curdled blood, then from a chewed-like lump of flesh (foetus) with formed and unformed parts. And We facilitate what We will in the wombs till an appointed time, and then We bring you out as babies. Then We facilitate conditions for you to attain to your maturity. And of you is he who is made to die, and of you is he who is reduced to the worst part of life (very old age), so that he does not remember anything of the knowledge he had acquired earlier. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down the water on it, it stirs to life and flourishes and produces every kind of a beautiful spouse of herbage"
