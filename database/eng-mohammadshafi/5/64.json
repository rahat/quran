    "text": "And the Jews say, \"Allah's hand is bound!\" Their hands are bound and they are cursed for what they said. Nay, both His hands are spread out, He expends as He pleases. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord will certainly make many of them more steeped in insolence and suppression of the Truth. And We have put enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire for war, Allah extinguished it. And they strive for mischief on earth. And Allah does not love the mischief mongers"
