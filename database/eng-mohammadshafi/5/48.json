    "text": "And We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, to confirm what has come before it of the Book and to act as an authority thereupon. So judge among them by what Allah has sent down, and follow not their vain desires which deviate from the truth that has come to you. For all of you, We have generated social customs and ways of life. And had Allah so willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you in what He has given you, so compete with one another in doing good deeds.h To Allah is the return of all of you. He will then explain to you what you differed in"
