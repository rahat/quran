    "text": "We did indeed send down the Torah, with guidance and light therein. Therewith, the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, and the Rabbis and the doctors in religious law, required to guard part of the Book of Allah and be witnesses thereto, judged for the Jews. Therefore fear the people not and fear Me, and do not buy a small benefit in exchange for My Verses/signs.h And they, who judge not by what Allah has sent down, are the suppressors of the Truth"
