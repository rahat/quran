    "text": "O you who believe! When death approaches any of you, call to witness among you, at the time of making the will, two just persons from among you, or two from among others than you if you are travelling in the land and death befalls you. Detain the two after the prayer, then, if you are in doubt, they shall both swear by Allah, \"We will not sell it for a price — and even though it is for a relative — and we will not hide the testimony. By Allah, then, certainly, we should be among the sinners"
