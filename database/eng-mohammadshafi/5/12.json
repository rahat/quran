    "text": "And Allah did take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains. And Allah said, \"I am indeed with you. If you establish prayer and give charity and believe in My Messengers and assist them and lend a good loan to Allah, I shall certainly condone your shortcomings, and shall certainly admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever has suppressed the Truth from among you after that, he has surely lost the right way"
