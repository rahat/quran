Did you tell mankind to take you and your mother for two gods besides Allah?\" He (Jesus) will say, \"Glory be to You, I couldn't say anything that I had no right to. If I had said it, You would indeed have known it. You know what is in my mind, and I do not know what is in Your mind. You are indeed the Knower of the things unseen"
