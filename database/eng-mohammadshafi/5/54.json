    "text": "O you who believe! If there be any from among you who turns back from his religion, then, in place of such people, Allah will bring a people whom He will love and who will love Him, humble with the believers, stern with those who suppress the Truth. They will strive in Allah's Path and will not fear the criticism of any critic. That is Allah's Favour which He gives to whom He wills. And Allah is Generous, Wise"
