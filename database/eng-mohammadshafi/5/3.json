    "text": "Forbidden to you are the carrion, and the blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is consecrated to any one other than Allah, and the strangled and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn and eaten by beasts unless you slaughter it properly berore its death, and that which is sacrificed over idols and that you try to know your future by means of arrows. That is a transgression. — This day, those, who have suppressed the Truth, have despaired of your religion; so fear them not, and fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My Favour upon you and approved for you Islam as religion. — But if one is compelled by hunger, and has no intention to sin, then Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"
