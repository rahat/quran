    "text": "O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in the state of Ihram. And whoever among you kills it intentionally, the penalty is the like of what he killed, from the cattle, as adjudged by two just persons among you, as an offering to be brought to the Kaabah — Or the expiation therefor is the feeding of the poor or commensurate fasting — so that whoever killed the game, may taste the burden of his deed. Allah has forgiven what is past. And whoever does it again, Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Omnipotent, Capable to take retribution"
