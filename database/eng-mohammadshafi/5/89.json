    "text": "Allah does not call you to account for anything trivial in your oaths, but He calls you to account for the binding terms of your oaths. The expiation of it, then, is the feeding of ten poor persons with the average food you feed your families with, or their clothing, or the freeing of a neck. And for the one, who cannot afford, three days of fasting. This is the expiation of your oaths when you take them. And guard your oaths! Thus Allah does make clear to you His Verses, so that you may feel grateful"
