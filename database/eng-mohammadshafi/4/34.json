    "text": "Men are the supports of women, since Allah has favoured some over others in certain respects, and since men are required to bear all family expenses from their (men's) property. The righteous women then are obedient guardians of privacy as Allah has guarded it. And as for those women, on whose part you fear refractoriness, admonish them, leave them alone in beds and turn away from them. Then if they obey you, do not resort to any punitive measure against them. Indeed, Allah is High, Great"
