    "text": "And it does not behove a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake, he should free a believing slave, and blood-money should be paid to the deceased's family unless they remit it as charity. If he was from a people hostile to you and was a believer, then the freeing of a believing slave, and if he was from a people, between whom and you there is a convenant, the blood-money should be paid to the deceased's family along with the freeing of a believing slave, and he who cannot find one should fast for two consecutive months in order to seek repentance from Allah. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise"
