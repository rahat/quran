    "text": "And test the orphans till they reach marriageable age. If you then find in them maturity of intellect, hand over to them their property. And do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they grow up. And a rich trustee should refrain from taking anything out of the orphans' property. And a poor Trustee may take just what is proper for his own consumption. And when you hand over to them their property, the transactions should be attested by witnesses. And Allah is Self-sufficient in maintaining proper accounts"
