    "text": "O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your way of life, and speak not but the truth about Allah. The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, was only a Messenger of Allah and His Word which He communicated to Mary and a soul from Him. Believe then in Allah and His Messengers, and say not, \"Trinity\"! Desist. It would be better for you [to desist from uttering this abomination.] Allah is the only Entity worthy of worship. HE is too Exalted to have a son! All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth is His. And Allah is sufficient as Manager of all things"
