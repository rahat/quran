    "text": "Then when you are due to perform the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting and while resting on your sides. Then when the situation for you becomes conducive, offer the prayer properly. Indeed the prayer is ordained for the believers at fixed times. . It is a war-like situation that is envisaged in Verses and above. But, in this Verse , other peace-time situations, like when one is travelling in a public transport, in a non-Islamic country, at the fixed time of the ritual prayer, are also envisaged. Stress is laid here on the performance of the salaah at the time fixed even though one is travelling, say, in a public transport bus. The prayer can be performed on a notional basis, then, just by remembering Allah, without going through the normal procedure for the prayer. This Verse is also the authority for the very ill, bedridden, person to offer his/her salah even while lying down"
