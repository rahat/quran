Then, when fighting was ordained for them, a section of these very people started fearing men, as they should fear Allah, or even more! And they said, \"O Lord! Why have you ordained fighting for us? Had you but given us a little more time!\" Say, \"Short is the enjoyment of this world. And the other world is better for him who fears Allah. And you shall not be wronged, even a bit"
