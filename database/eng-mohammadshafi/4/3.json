    "text": "And if you fear that you shall not be equitable in the matter of the orphans, then marry women suitable to you, two, three and four. But if you fear that you shall not be able to do justice between the wives, then be content with only one wife, or with what your right hands possess. That way it is more likely that you may not deviate from what is right"
