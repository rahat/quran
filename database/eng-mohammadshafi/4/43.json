    "text": "O you who believe! Go not to prayer while you are under the influence of intoxication, until you know what you say, nor while you are in an unclean state — unless on the move from one place to another — until you take a bath. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or any of you has come from the toilet or you have been in sexual contact with the women, and you cannot get water, simulate the cleaning act then with pure earth, wiping your faces and your hands therewith. Indeed, Allah is Lenient, Forgiving"
