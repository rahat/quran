If there be a victory for you from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you?\" And if the suppressors of Truth gain a share of success, they say, \"Did we not guard your interests and protect you from the believers.\" Then Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah has not provided a way for the suppressors of Truth to go (triumph) over the believers"
