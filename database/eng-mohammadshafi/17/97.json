    "text": "And the one, whom Allah guides, is the one who is guided. And the one, whom He leaves to go astray, you shall not find any awliya for him besides Him. And We will gather them together, on the Day of Resurrection, all lying on their faces â€” blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode shall be in Hell. We will increase the intensity of the blazing Fire, whenever it abates, for them"
