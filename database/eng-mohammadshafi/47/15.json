Therein are rivers of unpolluted water, and rivers of milk with unaltering taste, and rivers of wine delicious to drink, and rivers of purified honey. And therein they [the pious] shall enjoy all the fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Can such pious persons be likened to persons who are to abide in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink that would cut off their intestines"
