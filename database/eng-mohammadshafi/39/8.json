    "text": "When any affliction affects man, he cries out to his Lord, turning to Him alone. Then when his Lord bestows His favour upon him, he forgets what he had cried out to Him for before, and sets up rivals to Allah that they may lead others astray from His Path. Say, (O Prophet), \"Enjoy your suppression of the Truth for a while. Indeed, you will be among the inmates of the Fire"
