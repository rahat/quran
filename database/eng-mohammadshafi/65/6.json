    "text": "Allow the women [undergoing a waiting period] to live the same way you yourselves live as per your means. And harass them not to make their lives difficult. If they are pregnant, bear their expenses until they deliver. If they suckle your infants, pay them for it. Discuss things among yourselves honestly and honourably. And if you cannot bear with each other, let another woman suckle the infants for you"
