    "text": "O Prophet! When any of you men divorce your wives, divorce them with regard to their waiting period. And keep proper count of the period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Drive them not out of their homes [during the waiting period], nor should they themselves leave unless they openly commit an immoral act. And these are the bounds set by Allah. He who transgresses Allah's bounds, wrongs himself. You never know, Allah may well bring about some new situation after that"
