    "text": "It is He Who has sent down the Book upon you. Therein are Verses that are unambiguous and authoritative — these form the essence of the Book — and therein are other Verses, the interpretation of which is not clear to mankind. Those then with dishonesty in their minds, zealously pursue what is not clear thereof, seeking mischief and seeking its interpretation; but no one knows its interpretation but Allah. And persons, deeply versed in knowledge, say, \"We believe in it; it is all from our Lord.\" And none but those endowed with insight receive admonition.h"
