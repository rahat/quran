Be not like those who suppress the Truth and say of their brothers, travelling through the earth or fighting, \"If they had stayed back with us, they would not have died or been slain\", so that Allah makes it an anguish in their subconscious.h And Allah it is that gives life and causes death. And Allah sees all that you do"
