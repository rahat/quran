    "text": "Then, after the sorrow, He sent down the peace of slumber covering one section of you, while another section cared about their own selves, entertaining wrong thoughts about Allah â€” thoughts prevalent during the times of ignorance. They said, \"Have we had the authority to take decision in any matter?\" Say, \"The authority in taking decisions in all matters indeed rests with Allah.\" They hide within their own selves what they do not reveal to you. They say, \"If we had anything to do with taking any decision in this affair, We would not have been slain here.\" Say, \"Even if you had stayed in your houses, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to their decreed places of death.\" And in order thath Allah might test that which is in your conscious minds and purge that which is in your subconscious. For Allah knows well the secrets of your minds"
