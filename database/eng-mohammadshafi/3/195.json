    "text": "Their Lord then responded to them, \"Never shall I let any deed by anyone amongst you, male or female, go waste. You are kith and kin of one another. And those who emigrated and were forced out of their homes and were persecuted in My Path, and who fought and were killed, I shall certainly rid them of their evil spirits. And I shall certainly get them into Gardens with rivers flowing underneath\" â€” a reward from Allah! And with Allah is the best of the rewards"
