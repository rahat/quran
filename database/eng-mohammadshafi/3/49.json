And the sign is that I will make for you, from clay, the likeness of a bird. I will then blow into it and, with Allah's leave, it will become a living bird. And I will heal the blind and the lepers, and raise the dead to life, by Allah's leave. And, I will tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses. In this indeed is a sign for you, if you are believers"
