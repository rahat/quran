    "text": "David said (to the complainant), \"He has certainly wronged you by demanding that your ewe be added to his ewes! And indeed do many associates — except those who believe in Allah and do righteous deeds — wrong one another; but how few are those exceptions!\" And David at once realized that We had tested him (by presenting to him the case of the ewes)! And so he asked his Lord to forgive him, and bowed down, and turned to Him in repentance.h"
