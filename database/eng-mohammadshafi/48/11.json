    "text": "Those bedouins [nomadic Arabs staying in small oases in the desert and not in cities like Makkah and Medina] who remained behind [and did not accompany the Prophet in his mission] will say to you [Prophet], \"Our properties and our families kept us engrossed, so seek Allah's forgiveness for us.\" They will say with their tongues what is not in their minds. Say, \"Who then can intervene in the least on your behalf with Allah, if He wills to inflict any harm on you, or to give you any benefit? Allah is but well aware of all that you do"
