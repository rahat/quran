    "text": "Those indeed who believed and migrated and struggled hard in Allah's path with their property and their lives, and those who gave shelter and help â€” these are awliya of one another. And as for those who believed but did not migrate, you have no responsibility of being their wali until they migrate. And if they seek aid from you in matters of religion, aid is obligatory on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty. And Allah sees what you do"
