    "text": "It did not behove the inhabitants of Medina, and those around them of the Bedouins, to lag behind Allah's Messenger, nor to prefer their own selves over his. Because, no thirst, fatigue or hunger in Allah's way afflicts them, nor do they tread a path that enrages the suppressors of the Truth, nor do they attain from the enemy an attainment, but a good work is credited to their account therefor. Allah does indeed not allow the reward of good people to go waste"
