    "text": "They swear by Allah that they did not utter, and certainly they did utter, the word signifying suppression of the Truth. And they suppressed the Truth after they had declared their faith in Islam. And they intended to do what they could not. And they avenged not except for this that Allah and His Messenger enriched them out of His grace.Now if they repent, it will be good for them. And if they turn back to their evil ways, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. And they shall have none to be close to or to help them on earth"
