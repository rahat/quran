    "text": "The intercalation in a calendar is only an addition to the suppression of the Truth, wherewith the suppressors are led astray. They treat a month as non-sacred during one year and make it sacred in another to make up the number of months that Allah has made sacred. Thus do they then violate the sanctity of what Allah has made sacred! The evil of their deeds is made to seem fair to them. And Allah does not guide the people who suppress the Truth"
