    "text": "Indeed, Allah has bought from the believers their lives and their property for this, that they shall have the Paradise. They fight in Allah's Path, so they kill and get killed. It is a promise which He has bound Himself to, in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur'aan. And who can be more faithful to one's promise than Allah? So rejoice at the bargain you have struck; for, that is the highest success"
