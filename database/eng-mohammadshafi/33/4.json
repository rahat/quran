    "text": "Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him. And He has not made your wives, whom you desert by Zihar (i.e. by uttering that your wives' backs are like your mothers' backs), your mothers. And He has not made your adopted sons your sons. These are just words uttered by your mouths. And Allah tells the truth and it is He Who shows the way"
