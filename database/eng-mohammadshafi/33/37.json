    "text": "And when you said to him whom Allah and you had shown favour to, \"Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah!\" And you concealed in your heart what Allah would bring to light. And you feared men, and Allah has a greater right that you should fear Him! So when Zaid completed necessary divorce formalities from her (Zaid's wife), We gave her in marriage to you, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers about the wives of their adopted sons, when they (adopted sons) have completed necessary divorce formalities from them (their wives). And Allah's decree does ever get implemented"
