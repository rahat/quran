    "text": "You (Prophet) may defer the turn of any you please of them (Prophet's wives), and take to you any you please. And you may wish for any of those you had put off â€” no blame on you. They are thus more likely to calm down and not grieve, and be pleased, all of them, with what you give them. And Allah knows what is in your minds. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Kind"
