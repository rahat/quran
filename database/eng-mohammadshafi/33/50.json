    "text": "O Prophet! We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you; and a believing woman, if she gives herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a special provision for you only, not for the (other) believers. We do know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and concerning those whom their right hands possess. We give this clarification in order that no blame may lie on you. Andh Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful"
