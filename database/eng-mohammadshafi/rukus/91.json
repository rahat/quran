Let not those make you sad, who are quick in suppressing the Truth from among those who say, with their mouths, \"We believe\" and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews. They listen to falsehood. They listen to others who do not come to you. They transpose the word after it had been placed in its proper context, saying, \"If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, beware!\" And if Allah wills to put anyone to distress and hardship, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Allah does not want to purify the hearts of such people. Disgrace it is for them in this world, and a grave punishment for them in the Hereafter"
