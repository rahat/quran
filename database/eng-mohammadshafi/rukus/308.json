Let those whom your right hands possess (slaves/servants) and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times: before the Morning Prayer, whenever you take off your clothes (for rest) at noon, and after the Evening Prayer. These are three times of privacy for you. No restriction on you or on them at other times. Some of you have to be around others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the Verses, and Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise"
