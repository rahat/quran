And, indeed, most people are oblivious to Our signs.\" @ @ This revelation about the saving of the Pharaoh's body was made in the seventh century A.D. Although the Bible recounts the exodus and the drowning of the Pharaoh, it makes no mention of his body having been saved — nor does the Torah do it. And there is no evidence at all that anyone knew about it when the Qur'aan made this revelation. And except for the believers, no one knew about it as a fact till the nineteenth century when the body was discovered [Watch the YouTube Video]. This is one of the many signs giving clear indication of the Qur'aan being divine. But man in his self-destuctive obstinacy believes not"
