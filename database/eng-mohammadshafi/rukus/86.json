Treat not irreverently the rites sanctified by Allah; nor the sacred month, nor the offerings, nor the garlands, and nor those going/coming to the Sacred House seeking the Favour and Pleasure of their Lord. And when you are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage, then hunt. And let not hatred of a people, on account of their stopping you from going to the Sacred Place of Worship, lead you to transgression. And co-operate with one another in goodness/righteousness and piety, and do not co-operate with one another in sin and transgression, and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is severe in giving punishment"

That is a transgression. — This day, those, who have suppressed the Truth, have despaired of your religion; so fear them not, and fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My Favour upon you and approved for you Islam as religion. — But if one is compelled by hunger, and has no intention to sin, then Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"
