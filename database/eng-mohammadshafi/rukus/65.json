And Allah does know your faith. You are of one another. Marry those of them then — with the permission of their masters, and giving them their wedding gifts properly — who are chaste and do not seek extramarital sex taking you as just boyfriends for the purpose. And if, after marriage, they commit fornication, their punishment is half that for free women. This is for the one amongst you who fears falling into sin otherwise. And it is better for you to be patient. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
