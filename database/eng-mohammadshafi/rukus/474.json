It is like the growth of vegetation after the rain, which makes the skeptic wonder, but which then withers away, turns yellow and becomes worthless stubble. And in the Hereafter, severe punishment, forgiveness from Allah and His Pleasure! And the life of this world is nothing but means of deception"
