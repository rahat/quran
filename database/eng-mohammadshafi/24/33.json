    "text": "And let those who cannot get married live in continence until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace. And as for those who ask for a writ of freedom from among those whom your right hands possess (slaves), give them the writ if you know them to be good and worthy. And give them of the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls into prostitution while they desire to keep themselves chaste, in order to seek some advantage in the life of this world. And in case they are so compelled, then, indeed, Allah would be forgiving, merciful on them (the girls)"
