    "text": "There is no question of any blame on the blind, the lame, the sick, or you yourselves that you eat from your houses, or your fathers' houses or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or houses you possess the keys of, or your friends' (houses). You incur no sin that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet one another with a blessed and good salutation from Allah. Thus does Allah make clear to you the Verses so that you understand these properly"
