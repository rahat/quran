    "text": "Do you not see that Allah makes the cloud move, and then creates a bond within it, and then turns it into a mass, and you see the rain coming out from its midst?hAnd He sends down hail from mountains (of clouds) in the sky afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. Flash of His lightning could be so intense as to make one blind"
