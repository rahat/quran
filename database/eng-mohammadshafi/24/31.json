    "text": "And say to the believing women that they cast their looks down and guard their chastity and display not their beauty/charm except what has to remain open thereof, and let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms/cleavages, and not display their beauty/charm except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands possess, or the male servants who are beyond sexual desire, or the children who have not attained knowledge of the private aspects of women; and let them not strike their feet so that their hidden charm may get exposed; and turn in repentance to Allah all of you, O believers, so that you attain success"
