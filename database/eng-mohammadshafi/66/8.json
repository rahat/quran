    "text": "O you who believe! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance. It may well be that your Lord will efface from you your bad deeds, and will admit you into gardens underneath which rivers flow on a Day on which Allah will not put the Prophet, and those who believe with him, to any shame. Their light will run ahead of them, and on their right. They will pray, \"O our Lord! Make this light of ours shine for us forever, and forgive us our sins. YOU do indeed have power over all things"
