And the scribe should not refuse to write; as Allah has taught him, so he should write.And the one, upon whom lies the liability, should dictate. And he should fear Allah, his Lord, and omit nothing. Then if the one, upon whom lies the liability, is mentally unsound or weak or is himself unable to dictate, let his guardian dictate for him fairly. And two of you men should bear witness. If two men are not available, then one man and two women, you choose from among those present, should bear witness, so that if one of the women retracts, the other stands by her evidence. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are called to witness. Be not weary of writing a term contract, small or big. With Allah, that's a proper thing to do for better establishment of evidence and for removal of your doubts, unless it be a hand-to-hand commercial transaction commonly done among yourselves, in which case there is no blame on you if you do not put it in writing. And keep witnesses when you do any business. And cause no harm to the scribe, or to the witnesses. And if you do so, it would indeed be wickedness on your part. And fear Allah. And Allah teaches you.And Allah knows everything"
