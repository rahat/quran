They are likened in the Torah and in the Gospel to a seed which sends out its shoot and then strengthens it. It then becomes thick, and stands firm on its own stem, delighting the farmers. [Allah has so developed the character of believers] to enrage, through them, those who suppress the Truth. Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those of them who believe and do good deeds"
