But the righteous is one who believes in Allah, the Hereafter, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and who gives material assistance — despite one's love for material possessions — to the near and dear, the orphans, the impoverished, the wayfarer, the beggars and in the freeing of the bonded and who is regular and steadfast in prayers and gives to charity. And the righteous are those who keep their word when they give it and are patient in adversities and afflictions and during conflicts. Those are the true people; and those are the ones who are Allah-fearing"

But where the guilty person's fellow citizen concerned commutes the sentence, the commutation has to be adequately implemented, and the guilty person has to fulfil the terms of commutation in good measure. That is a remission from your Lord, and His grace! Then whoever transgresses thereafter — for him shall there be a painful punishment. to"
