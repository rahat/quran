And Allah determines the duration of the night and of the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep count of it [your night vigil], so He has turned to you in mercy. Read [study], then, as much of the Qur'aan as is easy for you. He knows that some among you would be sick and some others would be travelling in search of Allah's bounty [livelihood], and yet others would be fighting for the cause of Allah. So, read, then as much of it [Qur'aan] as is easy for you. And establish the prayer, pay the Zakaat, and give Allah a good loan. And the good deed you send in advance for your souls, you will find it with Allah. That is better and greater in reward. And seek Allah's forgiveness! Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"
