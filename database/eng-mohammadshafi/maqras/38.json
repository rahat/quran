Then when they have prostrated, let them go to your rear, and let another group who have not prayed come forward and pray with you, being on their guard and taking their arms. Those who suppress the Truth desire that you are off-guard as regards your arms and your property, so that they may then turn upon you in a single decisive swoop. And no blame on you, if you are inconvenienced by rain or if you are ill, that you put off your arms; but be on your guard. Indeed, Allah has prepared a disgraceful punishment for the suppressors of Truth"

Then when the situation for you becomes conducive, offer the prayer properly. Indeed the prayer is ordained for the believers at fixed times. . It is a war-like situation that is envisaged in Verses and above. But, in this Verse , other peace-time situations, like when one is travelling in a public transport, in a non-Islamic country, at the fixed time of the ritual prayer, are also envisaged. Stress is laid here on the performance of the salaah at the time fixed even though one is travelling, say, in a public transport bus. The prayer can be performed on a notional basis, then, just by remembering Allah, without going through the normal procedure for the prayer. This Verse is also the authority for the very ill, bedridden, person to offer his/her salah even while lying down"
