    "text": "O you who believe! Do not take My enemies — and your enemies — as close friends, treating them with affection. And they are bent on suppressing whatever Truth that has come to you. [And] they have driven the Messenger and you yourselves away, because you believe in Allah, your Lord! If you have set out to strive in My cause, seeking My pleasure, [then do not take them for your friends,] inclining affectionately towards them! And I am aware of what you conceal and of what you declare. And any of you who has done this [inclining affectionately towards enemies of Allah] — then he has surely strayed from the Right Path"
