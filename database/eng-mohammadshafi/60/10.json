    "text": "O you who believe! When believing women — Allah knows how good (or bad) their belief is — come to you as refugees, put them to a test. And if you have thus ascertained that they are believers, return them not to the suppressors of the Truth. These [the refugee women] are not lawful to the non-believers, nor are the latter lawful to the former. And return to them [the non-believers] what they had spent [on their former wives by way of mehr or obligatory marriage gift]. And you will be committing no sin if you then marry them after giving them their mehr. And hold not to the marriage-tie with women who continue to suppress the truth, and you may ask for the return of mehr you had spent on them. And, certainly, the non- believers [whose wives have come over to you] have the right to demand the mehr they had spent. That is Allah's Decree! He decrees on matters between you. And Allah knows all; He is wise"
