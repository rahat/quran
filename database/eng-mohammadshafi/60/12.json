Whenever believing women come to you to pledge to you that they would worship none but Allah, and would not steal, and would not commit adultery, and would not kill their children, and would not indulge in any falsehood devised between their hands and their feet [self-devised], and would not disobey you in doing what is right, then accept their pledge of allegiance, and pray to Allah to forgive them. Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"
