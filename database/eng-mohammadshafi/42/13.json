    "text": "Ordained for you, for the right conduct of life, that which He had enjoined upon Noah — and which We revealed to you [Prophet Muhammad] — and that which We had enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Stand firmly by the Allah-ordained way of life, and break not your unity therein. What you call them to, appears a tall order to those who worship others besides Allah. Allah calls to Himself whom He wills, and guides to Himself one who turns to Him"
