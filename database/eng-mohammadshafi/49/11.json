    "text": "O you who believe! Let not one community laugh at another, lest the latter be better than the former. Nor let women laugh at other women, lest the latter be better than the former. Insult not your own people, or call one another by nick-names. It is bad to be called by a name indicating transgressions against divine law after attaining to faith. And one that turns not in repentance â€” such are the wicked ones"
