Be helpers of Allah, like when Jesus son of Mary asked the disciples, \"Who are my helpers in the cause of Allah?\" they said, \"We are Allah's helpers.\" Then a section of the Children of Israel believed, and a section denied! Then We supported those who believed against their foe, and they [the believers] prevailed"
