He has enjoined that you do not worship anything besides Him, that you be good and kind to your parents, that you do not kill your children because of poverty — We provide sustenance for you, and for them — that you do not come near indecencies, whether done openly or in secrecy, and that you do not kill anyone, which act Allah has forbidden, except for the requirements of justice. This He has enjoined you with, that you may understand"
