    "text": "And leave alone those who have taken their religion (way of life) as just play and pastime, and whom this world's life has deceived. But do remind them with itlest an individual self is given up to destruction for what it has earned. It shall not have, other than Allah, any wali nor an intercessor, and even if it offers all possible ransom, it shall not be accepted from it. These are they who shall be given up to destruction for what they earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment, because they had been suppressing the Truth"
