    "text": "They ask you about fighting during the sacred/prohibited month. Say, \"Fighting therein is a grave matter. And, to Allah, obstructing from Allah's Path and from the Sacred Place of Worship, suppressing the truth about Him and driving its residents out from the Sacred Place are matters that are more grave! And, such mischievous behaviour is a more serious matter than killing.h to They won't let up in their fighting with you till they, if they could, turn you away from your religion (way of life). And as for the one amongst you who turns back from his religion and dies whilst suppressing the truth, the deeds of such people are of no use to them â€” both here, and in the Hereafter. And those will be the inhabitants of the Fire. They shall be there forever"
