    "text": "So then, when Tuaaloot set forth with his army, he said, \"Allah is certainly going to test you with a river. Whosoever quenches his thirst therefrom, he is not with us. And whosoever doesn't do so, but just drinks a palmful of water therefrom, he is indeed with us.\" And they did quench their thirst therefrom, except for a few of them. So then, as they — he and those who believed with him — crossed over, the others said, \"We do not have the strength this day to confront Jaaloot and his army.\" Said those who were certain they would be meeting Allah, \"How often, by Allah's Will, has a small party got the better of a big one! And Allah is with those who exercise patience"
