    "text": "They ask you about the new moons. Say, \"These are fixed points in time, for mankind and the Hajj.\" And it is not righteousness that you enter the houses from their backsides. The righteousness, on the other hand, comes from those who fear Allah. So enter the houses through their front doors, and fear Allah in order that you may be successful"
