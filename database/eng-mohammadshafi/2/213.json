    "text": "Mankind had once been a single community. Allah then raised the Prophets to herald news of a good future and to warn, and He sent down with them the Book with the Truth to distinguish right from wrong in matters of dispute among mankind.h And, differed in it not but those to whom it had been given — after clear Verses had come to them — because of rivalry amongst themselves.h, Allah then guided those who believed so that what they contended in the dispute in it was based on Truth by His leave. And Allah guides whomsoever He wishes towards Straight Path"
