    "text": "Those who consume Ar-Riba live not but like those whom Satan makes to stumble on in life, under his spell. That is because they assert, \"Business is just like Ar-Riba.h\" And Allah has made business lawful and Ar-riba unlawful. He, then, to whom admonition has come from his Lord and has since abstained from Ar-Riba — to him belongs what happened in the past. And to Allah returns his deed.And those who rebel — they shall be inhabitants of the Hell-fire, therein to remain forever"
