    "text": "And no sin upon you in that, you give hints of marriage proposals to women, or you just harbour such intentions. Allah knows you have them in your minds; but make no secret promises to them other than speaking to them in an appropriate manner. And finalise no marriage until after the prescribed period is over. And know that Allah knows what's there in your minds, so have fear of Him. And know that Allah is indeed Forgiving, Kind.h"
