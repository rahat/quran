    "text": "Of these Messengers, We have favoured some over others. Of them is one whom Allah talked to directly . And He exalted some in rank.hAnd We gave clear signs to Jesus, son of Mary, and We fortified him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah so willed, after clear signs had come to them, people of succeeding generations wouldn't have fought among themselves. But they differed. Some of them believed, and some suppressed the truth by wanton disbelief. Had Allah so willed, they wouldn't have fought. But Allah does what He wants"
