    "text": "Permitted to you are sexual relations with your wives at night after a fast. They are garments for you; and you are garments for them. Allah knew you used to betray yourselves; so He has bestowed His mercy upon you and forgiven you. Now then, enjoy sexual relationships with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you. And eat and drink until the light of dawn becomes distinct to you from the darkness preceding dawn. Then, fast till night. And have no sexual relationships with them while you are in the state of retreat, in total devotion to Allah, at the places of worship. These are restrictions ordained by Allah; so go not near these! Thus does Allah make His Verses/signs clear to mankind so that they become pious. to"
