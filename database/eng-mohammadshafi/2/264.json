    "text": "O you believers! Make not your offerings of obligatory charity null and void with boastfulness/bragging and insulth, like he who spends his wealth only to show off to people and who believes neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. His simile is like a barren rock covered with soil; then a heavy shower of rain lashes it and leaves it bare. Such people can do nothing with what they have earned.hAnd Allah does not guide the people who suppress the Truth"
