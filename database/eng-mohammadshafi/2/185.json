    "text": "Month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'aan — Guidance for mankind with clear substantiation thereof and the Criterion. One, who gets to witness the month, observes it in fasting. And whoever is ill or in journey, for him the count of the number of days of fasting is to be made up by observing fasts on other days. Allah wants to make things easy — and not difficult — for you to complete the number of days of fasting and hymn the greatness of Allah for the guidance that He has given you, and so that you do feel grateful"
