    "text": "And if you divorce them before you have touched them — but had already agreed upon a Mahr — then give half the Mahr unless they (women) forgo their rights, or he, in whose hand is the marriage-tie , forgoes his (and agrees to give the full Mahr). And it would be nearer to being pious that you (men) forgo. And do not forget to be good to one another, amongst yourselves. Allah does indeed see what you do"
