    "text": "And simile of those who spend their worldly possessions seeking Allah's pleasure, and out of their own inner conviction, is like a garden situated on a high ground: when heavy rain falls on it, it doubles its produce; if not a heavy rain, even a drizzle would do. And Allah is watching what you do"
