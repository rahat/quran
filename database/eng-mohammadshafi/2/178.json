    "text": "O you who believe! Prescribed for you, is the capital punishment in the matter of murdered persons. If a free man, a slave/servant or a female commits the crime, this prescribed punishment would accordingly be applicable only to that free man, that slave/servant or that female, respectively. But where the guilty person's fellow citizen concerned commutes the sentence, the commutation has to be adequately implemented, and the guilty person has to fulfil the terms of commutation in good measure. That is a remission from your Lord, and His grace! Then whoever transgresses thereafter â€” for him shall there be a painful punishment. to"
