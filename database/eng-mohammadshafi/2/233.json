    "text": "And the mothers, wishing to complete the course of breast-feeding, shall suckle their children for full two years. And upon the man who has fathered the child lies the responsibility of providing adequate food and clothing for the mother. No one is burdened, but only to the extent of one's capacity. No mother shall be put to any undue difficulty because of her child, and no father, because of his child. And responsibility likewise devolves upon the heir. If then one intends weaning the child from breast-feeding with mutual consent and consultation, no sin on them both. And if you intend a foster mother to suckle your children, no sin upon you when you make the payment as agreed upon equitably. And fear Allah, and know that Allah does indeed watch what you do"
