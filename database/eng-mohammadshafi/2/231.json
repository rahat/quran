    "text": "And when you divorce women and their waiting period gets over, then retain them in honour or relieve them in honour.hAnd retain them not for harassing them wickedly; whosoever does that, does indeed wrong one's own self. And treat not Allah's Verses/signs as just jokes,hand remember Allah's favours upon you and remember that which He sent down upon you, from the Book and the Wisdom, to admonish you with. Fear Allah and know that Allah is aware of each and everything"
