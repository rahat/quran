So invoke your Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us agricultural products like herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils and onions.\" He said, \"Would you change what is better for what is worse? Go you down to a town! You will certainly get there what you want!\" And they were hit by the ignominy and the poverty, and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they were suppressing Allah's signs/Verses and they were killing the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and they were crossing the limits"
