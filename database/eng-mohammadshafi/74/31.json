    "text": "And We have appointed none but angels as Guardians of the Fire. And We have not fixed their number [], but only as a trial for those who suppress the Truth, and as a means of certainty for the People of the Book and increase in Faith for the Believers, so that no doubts are left for the People of the Book and the Believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the suppressors of the Truth may say, \"What intention does Allah have by this issue [of appointing only guards for hundreds of thousands of sinners put in Hell]?\" Thus does Allah send astray whom He wills and guide whom He wills. And none but He knows [the enormity of] your Lord's forces! And this [Qur'aan] is nothing but Admonition/Reminder for mankind.h"
