One of them asked, \"How long have you been here?\" They said, \"We have been here for a day or less than a day.\" Some said, \"Your Lord alone knows how long you have been. Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city, and let him find and bring some good food for you. And let him ensure that none comes to know about you"
