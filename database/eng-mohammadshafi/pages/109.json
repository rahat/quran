If you establish prayer and give charity and believe in My Messengers and assist them and lend a good loan to Allah, I shall certainly condone your shortcomings, and shall certainly admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever has suppressed the Truth from among you after that, he has surely lost the right way"

They pervert the Word from its contextual sense and they have forgotten a part of what they were reminded of. And you will not cease to find treachery in them, except in a few of them. But then leave them alone and overlook. Allah does indeed love those who do good deeds"
