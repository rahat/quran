And shave not your heads until the animal is duly sacrificed, . But if any of you be sick or has an affliction in the head, he is exempted from this injunction provided he compensates by observing fast, spending for the needy or sacrificing. And when circumstances are favourable to you, then for the one who takes advantage of the Umrah before the Hajj, sacrificing an animal that one can afford is a must. But for the one who cannot afford, three days of fasting during the Hajj and seven after you return home. That is, ten in all. This provision is for the one whose family does not live in the vicinity of the Sacred Place of Worship , . And fear Allah and beware! Allah is severe in punishment"
