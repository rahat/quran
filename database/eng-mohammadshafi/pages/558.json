Drive them not out of their homes [during the waiting period], nor should they themselves leave unless they openly commit an immoral act. And these are the bounds set by Allah. He who transgresses Allah's bounds, wrongs himself. You never know, Allah may well bring about some new situation after that"

Call to witness two reliable men from among you and keep your testimony upright for Allah. This admonition is given to one who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And one who fears Allah, He will make for him a way out [of his difficulties]"
