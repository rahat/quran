And [Allah would have commanded you to fight them] had it not been for the believing men and believing women [in Makkah] whom you might unwittingly have trodden down, and on whose account you might have, unknowingly, become guilty. [Allah wit eld your hands from the suppressors of Truth] so that He may bring whoever He will into His mercy. If they [the believers] had been clearly separated [from the non-believers], We would have punished those who have suppressed the Truth with a painful punishment"
