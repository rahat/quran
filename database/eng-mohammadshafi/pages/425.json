And you may wish for any of those you had put off â€” no blame on you. They are thus more likely to calm down and not grieve, and be pleased, all of them, with what you give them. And Allah knows what is in your minds. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Kind"

But enter at the time you are invited, and as soon as you have finished your meals, disperse! And linger not for a customary talk. This does indeed cause inconvenience to the Prophet, but he is too embarrassed to tell you. And Allah is not embarrassed to express the truth. And when you ask for anything from them (ladies of the Prophet's household), ask of them from behind a curtain. This would be better for the purity of your hearts and of theirs. And it behoves you not to cause inconvnience to the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after him. This is indeed a matter of great significance with Allah"
