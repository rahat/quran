They treat a month as non-sacred during one year and make it sacred in another to make up the number of months that Allah has made sacred. Thus do they then violate the sanctity of what Allah has made sacred! The evil of their deeds is made to seem fair to them. And Allah does not guide the people who suppress the Truth"

He was one of the two in the cave when he said to his companion, \"Grieve not, Allah is indeed with us.\" Then Allah caused him to be calm and peaceful and strengthened him with armies you couldn't see. And He lowered the word of those who suppressed the Truth and raised the word of Allah high. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise"
