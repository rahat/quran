But it is Allah Who can do anything and everything. Have the believers then become despaired of the Truth that had Allah so willed, He could have guided all mankind!? And disaster shall not cease to afflict those that suppress the Truth because of what they do, or to strike near their homes, until what Allah has promised comes to pass. And, indeed, Allah fails not to keep the appointment"

Nay, the intrigue indulged in by the suppressors of the Truth is made to look pleasing to them and they are held back from the Right Path. And him whom Allah has led astray, no one can guide"
