We ordained for the Children of Israel that if one killed a person — not in retaliation for killing another person or for spreading mischief on earth — it is as if he/she killed the entire mankind. And one who saved a life, it is as if he/she saved the entire mankind. And certainly Our Messengers came to them with clear signs. Then indeed, thereafter, many of them did commit transgression on the earth"
