That [community] is such that He has decreed Faith in their minds and has strengthened them with a Spirit from Him. And He will admit them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. Those are the ones in Allah's Party. Is it not members of Allah's Party that indeed are successful"

You did not think they would go, and they thought their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah came upon them from an unexpected quarter and cast such terror into their minds that their houses were pulled down by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers. Learn a lesson, then, O you endowed with insight"
