    "text": "Those who follow the unlettered Messenger-Prophet, whom they find mentioned with them in the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins them to do good things and forbids them from bad things, and makes pure, wholesome things lawful to them and impure things unlawful, and removes from them their burden and the fetters which were upon them. So then those who believe in him, honour him and help him, and follow the lightwhich has been sent down with him â€” those it is that succeed"
