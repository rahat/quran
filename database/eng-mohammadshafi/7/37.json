Such persons get what is destined for them in this life, until, Our Messengers come to them causing them to die and ask, \"Where are those whom you used to invoke and worship besides Allah?\" They would say, \"They have deserted us.\" And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were suppressors of the Truth"
