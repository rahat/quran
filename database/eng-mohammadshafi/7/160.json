    "text": "And We divided them into twelve tribal groups. And when his people asked Moses for water, We inspired him, \"Strike the rock with your staff!\" There then gushed forth twelve springs therefrom. Thus did all come to know their respective sources of drinking water. And We made the clouds to provide shelter over them and We sent to them manna and quails. \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you.\" And they did not do Us any harm, but they did harm to their own souls"
