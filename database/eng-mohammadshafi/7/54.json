    "text": "Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time, and Who then ascended the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, the night pursuing the day incessantly. And the sun and the moon and the stars are subservient to His command. Aren't the Creation and the Command His? Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
