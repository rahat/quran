Had You so willed, You could have destroyed them before â€” and me too. Will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done? It is indeed nothing but a trial from You. You make whom You will to go astray with it and You guide whom You will. You are our Wali. So forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the best of the forgivers"
