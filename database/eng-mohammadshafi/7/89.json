    "text": "We should be forging a lie against Allah if we return to your way of life after Allah has delivered us from it. And it befits us not that we should return to it, unless Allah, our Lord, so wishes. Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In Allah do we trust. Our Lord! Decide justly between us and our people. And You are the Best of judges"
