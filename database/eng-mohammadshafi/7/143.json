    "text": "And when Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord! Reveal yourself to me so that I may see You.\" He said, \"You cannot see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me.\" But when his Lord manifested His glory to the mountain, He made it crumble and Moses fell down in a swoon. Then when he recovered, he said, \"Glory to You! I turn to You in repentence, and I am the first of the believers"
