And I had no authority over you except to call you to me, and you obeyed me! So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot be of any help to you now, nor can you be of any help to me. I do indeed deny that you had worshipped me, besides Allah, before.\" For the wicked people there shall indeed be a painful punishment"
