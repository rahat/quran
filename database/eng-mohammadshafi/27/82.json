    "text": "And when the word gets fulfilled about them, We shall bring out for them a creature from the earth, which will tell them that mankind had no real faith in Our Verses/signs. @ @ My undedrstanding of this Verse is that it applies to modern man's unabashed gobbling up of the theory of evolution. Protagonists of this theory assert that mankind evolved itself from lower forms of life through processes of natural selection and survival of the fittest. They reject the Qur'aanic assertion that a Super-intelligent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Being has consciously, deliberately or purposefully created mankind and everything else in the Universe. The thought of such a Creator is anathema for the atheists subscribing to the theory of evolution. This theory could well be the creature spoken of in this Verse, telling those who believe in it that they have no real faith in the Qur'aanic Verses/signs. In this context I invite my readers to go through my booklet Why Do I Believe In Islam"
