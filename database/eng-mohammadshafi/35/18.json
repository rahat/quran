    "text": "And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden. And if any body weighed down by a burden calls attention to its heavy load, nothing of it will be carried by another, even though the latter be near of kin. You can warn only those who fear their Lord without seeing Him, and have established the Prayer. And whoever has purified himself, purifies only for his own good. And to Allah is the final destination"
