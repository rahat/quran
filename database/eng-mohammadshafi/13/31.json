    "text": "And the suppressors of the Truth like to think that they would believe if only the mountains were moved by the Qur'aan, or the earth was cut asunder thereby, or the dead were made to speak! But it is Allah Who can do anything and everything. Have the believers then become despaired of the Truth that had Allah so willed, He could have guided all mankind!? And disaster shall not cease to afflict those that suppress the Truth because of what they do, or to strike near their homes, until what Allah has promised comes to pass. And, indeed, Allah fails not to keep the appointment"
