    "text": "For every human being there are angels who take turns, in front of him/her and behind, to guard him/her by Allah's command. Allah does indeed not change the condition of a people until they themselves change it. And when Allah wills adversity on a people, there is no averting it. And besides Him they have no ruling authority to defend and take care of them"
