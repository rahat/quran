    "text": "He sends down water from the sky. And valleys flow with water as per their given measure. And the stream bears the swelling froth. And from what they melt in the fire for making ornaments or apparatus arises similar froth. Thus does Allah compare truth with untruth. Then, as for the froth, it just passes away as a worthless thing. And as for that which profits the people, it remains on the earth. Thus does Allah explain things giving examples"
