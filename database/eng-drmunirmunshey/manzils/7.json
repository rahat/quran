He knows that (at any given time) some of you would be sick, and others would be travelling in search of Allah´s bounties. Still others would be (engaged in) fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur´an as you can, establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and advance the virtuous loan to Allah. Whatever good deeds you send ahead for yourself are there with Allah. You will receive the rewards for your deeds (on the Day of Judgment), far better and bigger (than your deeds deserve). Seek the forgiveness of Allah, for Allah is oft-Forgiving, the most Merciful"
