    "text": "The day of gathering _ that day when He will gather all of you together _ will be the day of loss and gain, (the day of reparation and redress of wrongful deeds). He (Allah) will remove (and cleanse) the shortcomings (and sins) of the one who believes in Allah, and does righteous acts. He will admit such a person into paradise to live forever; rivers run right through it. That is the greatest success"
