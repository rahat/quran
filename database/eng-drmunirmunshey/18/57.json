    "text": "Who could be worse than the one who turns away and shuns the signs of his Lord, even though he is being reminded of them? He forgets the kinds of deeds he has committed. Indeed, We have set a lid over their hearts; so they fail to understand (the QurÂ´an). There exists a heavy load in their ears. Therefore, you may call them towards the truth, but they shall not be led on to the right path"
