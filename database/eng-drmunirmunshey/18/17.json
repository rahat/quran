    "text": "(Had you been there) you would see (the rays of) the sun _ as it rises and sets _ falling obliquely across the right of the cave and turning away past its left, while the men lay in the midst (of the cave). These are the signs of Allah. The rightly guided is the one whom Allah guides. You will not find any patron to guide the one who is led astray"
