    "text": "(Oh prophet), the appearance of the hypocrites and their physiques are pleasing to look at. Their speech is so glib and pleasant, one likes to just keep on listening. It is as if they were carved out of wood and propped up (against the wall). They think (like cowards), that every call to action is against them. They are the enemies! Beware of them! May Allah curse them. How perverted are they"
