    "text": "(The condition of the unbelievers is) like darkness in the deep dark sea covered over by a huge wave, which is swarmed over by another tide. Up above are thick heavy clouds. (Total) darkness, one atop another! If one pulls out oneÂ´s hand, one could hardly see it. The one whom Allah deprives of light cannot obtain light elsewhere"
