    "text": "There is no restriction upon the blind, the lame or the sick to eat (at anybodyÂ´s home); just as you are at liberty (either) to eat at your own home or the homes of your father, mother, brothers, sisters, maternal uncles and aunts and the paternal uncles and aunts. You may also eat at the homes in your possession or those belonging to your friends. There is no prohibition: you may eat alone or together. But when you enter the home, salute the people there with the noble and blessed greeting from Allah. In this manner, Allah clarifies the verses for you. Perhaps you would understand"
