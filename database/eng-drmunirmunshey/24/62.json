    "text": "The real believers are those who have faith in Allah and His messenger. On a collective mission with the messenger, they do not depart without asking leave. Those who seek permission before leaving are actually the ones believing in Allah and His messenger. (Oh messenger), if they ask your leave to go, in order to attend to any of their concerns, you may allow whomever you want and ask Allah to forgive them. Indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
