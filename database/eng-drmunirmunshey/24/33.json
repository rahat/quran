    "text": "Those lacking the means to marry should abstain until Allah enriches them by His grace. Write down for your slaves _ those who desire to work for their freedom _ (the terms of emancipation) if you know them to be worthy and able. Give them something from the wealth Allah has granted you. Do not _ to gain the worldly benefits _ compel your slave girls into prostitution, while they wish to remain chaste. For the slave girl compelled in this manner, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind"
