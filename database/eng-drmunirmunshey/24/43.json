    "text": "Do you not observe? Allah shoves the clouds gently, and brings several of them together into a pile. Then you see raindrops falling down from it. From the mountains, He raises the hailstorm into the sky and rains it down. With it, He strikes those He wants, while He spares others. The lightning flashes (of the storm) almost blind the vision"
