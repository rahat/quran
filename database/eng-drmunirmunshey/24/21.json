Whoever follows the footsteps of Shaitan (should know) that he always exhorts the commission of obscene and vile deeds and the prohibited acts. The favors of Allah and His mercy are upon you. Otherwise, none of you could have ever acquired the purity of heart. But Allah purifies whomever He wants. Allah is all-Hearing and all-Knowing"
