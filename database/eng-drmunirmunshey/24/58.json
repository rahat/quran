    "text": "Oh you believers, let your slaves and young pre-puberty children seek permission (to come to you) during the following three times: before the morning prayer, at around noon when you undress (for a nap), and after the night prayers. These three timings are private! At other times, there is no harm either for them or you (to come unannounced). After all, you have to move about and see each other. Thus, Allah clarifies the verses for you. Allah is all-Knowing, all-Wise"
