While those who do not believe, have the forces of evil as their friends; they lead them out of light, into the very depths of darkness. Such ones shall be the inmates of the fire. They will stay there forever"

Ibraheem said to him, \"My Lord is the One Who grants life and gives death.\" (The emperor) said, \"I, too, give life and death.\" Ibraheem said, \"In fact, Allah it is, Who causes the sun to rise from the east. You cause it to rise from the west (if you can).\" Thus, the one who disbelieved was left perplexed and speechless. Allah does not guide the nation of wrong doers"

He said (to himself), \"How will Allah bring the people of this town back to life after death?\" Thereby, Allah let him die (and stay dead) for a hundred years. Then, He brought him back to life and asked him, \"How long did you stay (dead)?\" The man replied, \"I stayed a day or perhaps a part of it.\" (Allah) said, \"In fact, you have stayed (in this state) a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink. It hasnÂ´t become stale at all. Now, look at your donkey. We will turn you into a sign for (other) people. Look at the bones and watch how We gather them all together; then watch how We clothe them with flesh.\" As the reality became evident to him, he remarked,\"I know now that Allah is capable of doing all things"
