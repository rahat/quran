Whoever drinks (and quenches his thirst with) the water from the river shall not be (a devotee of) mine. Truly, (a follower of) mine would be the one who avoids the taste of the water from the river, save a sip or two out of the hollow of his hand.\" But, except for a few, they all drank the water from the river. When Talut, and those who believed in him, crossed (the river), the others said, \"We do not have any strength left today against Goliath and his armies.\" Those who were certain about meeting their Lord, replied, \"How often has it been that a smaller group prevailed over a much larger group, by Allah´s leave?\" And Allah is certainly with the patient ones"
