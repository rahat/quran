Such are the believers upon whose hearts Allah has etched faith; He has bolstered their belief with His true guidance and light. He will usher them into paradise, right through which, run rivers. They will live there forever! Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah! Beware, it is (really) the party of Allah that will triumph"

You never thought they would depart (without resistance). And they thought their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah came upon them from where they least expected. He cast terror in their hearts, so they ruined their homes with their own hands, and the hands of the believers. So learn the lesson, Oh you, endowed with sights"
