You violated (the order) as soon as He displayed to you that which you (longed for and) loved _ (the spoils of war). Among you are some who, covet (the benefits and pleasures of) this world, and among you are others who desire the (benefits of the) afterlife. Thus, in order to put you through a test, He diverted you from your foe. He has, in fact (already) forgiven you. Allah is most Gracious to the believers"
