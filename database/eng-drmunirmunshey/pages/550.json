If you determine that they (really) are the believers, then do not repatriate them back to their non-believing husbands (or family). The believing women are not lawful for the non-believing men; nor are the non-believing men lawful for the believing women. Return to their non-believing husbands whatever they had spent (as nuptial dowry). You would not be committing a sin, if you marry such women, provided you pay them their due. Do not keep the non-believing women married to you. Ask them to return what you had spent upon them (as nuptial dowry). Let the non-believing husbands (likewise) receive the amounts they had spent on their (believing) wives. This is the command of Allah! He judges between you; Allah is the all-Knowing, the Wisest"
