He will most certainly appoint them the successors on earth, just like He appointed the people prior to you as successors. He will consolidate their way of life, much to their satisfaction. He will change their present state of insecurity and fear, into one of safety and peace. They would worship Me and would not associate anyone as My partner. Whoever disbelieves after this, is certainly wicked"

These three timings are private! At other times, there is no harm either for them or you (to come unannounced). After all, you have to move about and see each other. Thus, Allah clarifies the verses for you. Allah is all-Knowing, all-Wise"
