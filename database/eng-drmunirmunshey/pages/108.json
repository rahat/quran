            "text": "Oh you who believe! Before you rise for ´salat´ (for prayers), wash your face and your hands up to your elbows, run your (wet) hands across your head, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. Clean yourself (by bathing) if you are unclean (following a sexual experience). In case you are ill, or on a journey, or if you have been to the toilet, or if you have had (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water to clean yourself, then perform ´tayyamum´. Find a (rock or a) slab of earth and (after touching it) run your hands over your face and hands. Allah does not want to burden you with inconveniences. Rather, He wants to purify you and complete His blessings upon you. Perhaps, you would be grateful"
