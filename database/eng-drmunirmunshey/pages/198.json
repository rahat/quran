They had a lot more wealth and descendants. So, go ahead and enjoy your share (of life) just like those before you. Stay engrossed (and lost) in play and pleasure, just like those before you. Their efforts (and endeavors) amounted to nothing in the life of this world, or in the afterlife. Such are the losers"
