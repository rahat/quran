Corruption (and oppression) is (far) more serious than bloodshed. They will not cease to engage you in combat, till they turn you away from your faith, if they (ever) can. Those who abandon the (true) faith and die as unbelievers, would lose (the worth of) all their (good) deeds in this world and the life-to-come.
