Never is there a secret conference of three, where He is not the fourth (listening in); nor of five, where He is not the sixth (listening). Even when there are less (than three) or more than that number (holding secret talks), He is (always) with them no matter where they might happen to be. Later, on the Day of Judgment, He will tell them everything they had done! Indeed, Allah knows every single thing"

They conspired to commit sins and wrongful acts, and to disobey the messenger. When they visit you, they greet you in a manner in which Allah did not greet you. (Mischievously, they twist words, as they salute you). In their hearts they say, \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" For them, hellfire is enough! They shall burn in it! What a despicable destination"
