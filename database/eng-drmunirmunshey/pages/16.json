The Shaitans disbelieved (and denied). They taught people the craft of magic and that (esoteric) art that was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut at Babylon. Before the two angels would teach that craft to anyone, they would declare, \"We are actually just a trial for you. So do not (succumb to temptations and) be the disbelievers.\" Yet they studied from those two (angels), that which caused estrangement between a man and his wife. No one could they harm by it, except by Allah´s permission. They studied that which could only hurt them; it did not benefit them (at all). They definitely knew that the one who acquires this (craft) shall have no share in the (blessings of the) life-to-come. And evil indeed was what they purchased (and paid for) with their souls! If only they knew"
