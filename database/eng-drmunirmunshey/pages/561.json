Allah, your Lord, may just rid you of your sins (and your faults and flaws); He will usher you into paradise, through which run the rivers. Allah will not let the prophet and those who believe in him, be humiliated on that day. The light (emanating from them) would run in front of, and to the right of them. They shall call out, \"Our Lord, (please) complete for us our light, and forgive us. Indeed, You have power over all things"
