Write down for your slaves _ those who desire to work for their freedom _ (the terms of emancipation) if you know them to be worthy and able. Give them something from the wealth Allah has granted you. Do not _ to gain the worldly benefits _ compel your slave girls into prostitution, while they wish to remain chaste. For the slave girl compelled in this manner, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind"

The lamp is in a glass which itself gleams like a radiant star. It is lit by the oil of the blessed tree _ neither from the West nor the East. The oil of the lamp is ready to glow by itself even without being kindled. The bright luminous light is atop another brilliant light. Allah guides towards this light whomever He wants and Allah quotes this parable for the people. Allah is knowledgeable of all things"
