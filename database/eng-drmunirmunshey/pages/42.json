We granted the manifest proofs to Jesus, son of Mary, and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit _ (the angel Gibrael). Had Allah wished, those who followed the prophets, would not have fought each other, (especially) since they had seen the clear proofs. But they differed (and splintered into groups): some of them believed, while there were some of them who disbelieved. Had Allah wished, they would not have fought (each other). But Allah does what He wants"

Everything in the heavens and everything on the earth belongs to Him. Who can dare intercede in His presence except by His leave? He knows everything that lies ahead of them and everything that is behind them. They shall never know anything about Him except what He wills. His chair _ (His authority and influence, His domain and command) _ extends over the heavens and the earth. Preserving and protecting them does not tire (or burden) Him (in the least). He is the most High, the Greatest"
