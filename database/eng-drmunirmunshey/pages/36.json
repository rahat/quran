It is not permissible for them to conceal that, (the life,) which Allah has planted in the womb, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. During this period, their husbands have the right to take them back, in case they desire reconciliation. Women have their rights, similar to the rights over them, which are well known. Of course, men are (as regards rights and responsibilities) a notch above women. And Allah is the most Powerful, and the Wisest"

It is not permissible for you to take back anything you had given to her, except when (divorce occurs because) the two of them fear that they might not be able to abide by the bounds of Allah. If you fear that the two of you may not be able to stay within the bounds of Allah, then there is no sin upon either of you if she gives back something to gain her freedom. These are the bounds of Allah. Do not transgress them. Those who overstep the bounds of Allah are indeed the evildoers"
