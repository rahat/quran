Then, (cut them up and) place each piece on a (different) mountain. Then call them. They will (respond and) come to you in a hurry.

Their example is that of the boulder covered by a thin layer of topsoil. When a rainstorm strikes, (the topsoil washes off and) the rock is left bare. They wonÂ´t be able to benefit from the good deeds they earn. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"
