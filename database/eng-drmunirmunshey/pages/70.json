Another group that cared only about itself (fretted and) entertained wrongful notions about Allah. Notions (that were born) of ignorance! They said, \"Have we the (right of) decision in any matter?\" Say (to them), \"The (right of) decision in all matters rests with Allah (exclusively).\" They do not declare to you what they conceal in their hearts. They (actually) said (in their heart), \"If we had a say in the matter, we would not have been killed here.\" Say, \"Even if you had stayed home, those who were destined to be killed would have emerged on their own, and gone forth to that (exact) spot where they were to die.\" So that, Allah may put to test (and expose) that which is (buried) in your chest. So that, He may scrutinize (and purify) that, which is in your heart. Allah is well Aware of what exists in your chest"
