Those who seek permission before leaving are actually the ones believing in Allah and His messenger. (Oh messenger), if they ask your leave to go, in order to attend to any of their concerns, you may allow whomever you want and ask Allah to forgive them. Indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
