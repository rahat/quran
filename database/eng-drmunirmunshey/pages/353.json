Ask them to pull their veil-cloths down across their bosom, and not show their adornments to anyone except their husbands, fathers, husband´s father, sons, husband´s sons, brothers and their sons, sister´s sons, their women, the female slaves they own, the men-servants too old to have erotic desires, and boys not yet old enough to have awareness of the carnal. Ask them not to stamp their feet hard, in order to display (and jingle the jewelry worn on their feet and other) hidden adornments (under their outer garments). Oh you believers! Turn _ all of you _ towards Allah in repentance. Perhaps you will prosper"
