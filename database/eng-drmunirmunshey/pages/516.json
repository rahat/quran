If one of the groups is the transgressor, (all of you should) fight the group that is unjust, until it complies and returns to the commands of Allah. Once that happens, make peace between the groups fairly and equitably. Indeed Allah loves those who are just"

Similarly, do not let (some) women deride other women, because the women being laughed at, may happen to be better. Do not defame or slander each other. Do not yell (racial, ethnic or other) slurs and epithets at each other. After entering faith, it is not right to insult others with disdainful names. Those who fail to repent and desist are really the evildoers"
