And you may get back together with any of your wives you had previously estranged. You are not to be blamed. This is more likely to keep them happy, free from grief and contented with what you give them. Allah knows whatever exists in the hearts of all of you. Allah is all-Knowing, and He is the most Gentle"

If you are invited to dine at the prophet´s home, arrive on time (not too early) and disperse after you have finished eating. Do not overstay and linger on in conversation. That bothers the prophet, and he is too embarrassed to tell you. But Allah is not ashamed of telling the truth! When you have to ask the wives of the prophet about anything, do so from across a screen. That is more upright, and it keeps your and their hearts more unadultrated. It is not right for you to aggravate the prophet, and it is improper for you to ever marry any of his wives after his death. Indeed that, according to Allah, is a serious offence"
