They deem a month ´not sacred´ one year and declare it to be sacred the next, in order to make up the numbers of sacred months (in a year). Thus, they (find a way to) legitimize what Allah has forbidden. Such an evil course seems pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"

The two of them were (hiding) in a cave when he said to his companion, \"Do not worry, Allah is with us.\" So Allah, by His grace, caused the (reassuring) peace and serenity to descend upon him. (Allah) strengthened him with forces you could not see. He brought the words (and slogans) of the unbelievers down to the lowest level, while the word of Allah is (always) Supreme. Allah is the Almighty, and the Wisest"
