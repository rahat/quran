Do not hold her in order to hurt (or harass) her, else you would transgress (the bounds of Allah). Whoever does that commits an outrage upon himself. Do not take the laws of Allah as a jest (or treat them frivolously). Remember the favors of Allah upon you, and the scriptures and the wisdom He has revealed to you. It instructs you (towards the right path). So, be (devoted and) dutiful towards Allah and be sure that indeed Allah knows every single thing"

(The two may wed) in an accepted manner, provided there is a mutual consent. The one who believes in Allah and the Day of Judgment is (hereby) being admonished. It is closer to piety, and closer to purity. Allah knows it (all), and you know nothing (at all)"

The father must bear her living expenses _ the cost of food and clothing in an accepted manner. No one should be burdened more than oneÂ´s ability to bear. Let the mother not suffer (unduly) because of her child, nor the father on account of his child. The heirs carry the same liability (as that of the father). There is no harm if both (parents), after mutual consultation and consent, want the infant weaned. There is (also) no harm if you decide to hire a wet-nurse to suckle the child, provided you pay her what is due in an accepted manner. Fear Allah, and know (for sure) that Allah (vigilantly) watches over everything you do"
