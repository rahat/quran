Allah said, \"I will be with you, provided you establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, believe in My messengers and honor and assist them, and advance a (sincere) virtuous loan to Allah. I will rid you of your sins (and your faults and flaws). I will certainly usher you into paradise through which run the rivers. If, despite the covenant, anyone of you disbelieves, then he will definitely go astray and deviate from the straight path of piety and righteousness"

They lift the words (of their scriptures) out of context and they have forgotten a good part of the advice they were given. Except a few of them, you will always hear about the treachery and deceit committed by them. So, excuse them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the pious"
