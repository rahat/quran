During the battle) if you are among the believers leading ´the salat´ then let (only) one group stand in salat behind you; let them bear their arms while they stand in ´salat´. After they perform the prostration, let them move to the rear (and stand guard). Let the other group that has not yet performed their ´salat´ come forward and stand behind you. (But during all this time) they should be on guard and bear their arms. The unbelievers would love to catch you unawares and neglectful of your weapons and your belongings, so they can launch a surprise attack and route you with a single swoop. You incur no sin, if you put down your weapons, because you experience a distress due to rain or because you are ill. But (always) be on guard. Indeed, Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers"
