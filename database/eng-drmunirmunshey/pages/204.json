They would definitely swear that (by building that mosque) they had intended nothing but good. But Allah bears witness that they are certainly the liars"

In fact, the mosque that was based and built on piety right from the first day is definitely a far better (and worthier) place for you to stand in prayers. In that mosque are men who like to keep themselves clean and pure. Of course, Allah loves those who keep themselves clean and pure"

The one who raised his building on piety and the pleasure (and approval) of Allah, or the one who raised his building upon the brink of a crumbling water-worn precipice. It will crumble and topple him right into the fire of hell. Allah does not guide the nation of wrong doers"

It is a (firm and) binding promise made by Him, and repeated in the Torah, the Gospels and the QurÂ´an. And who could be truer to his promise than Allah? So be happy with the bargain you have just transacted. That, indeed, is the tremendous triumph"
