Yet, from both of them you attain fresh meat to eat, and extract pearls to wear. You see huge ships plough through the waves so you may seek His blessings (and earn your livelihood). Perhaps you will feel grateful"

The one heavily loaded (with sins) may ask others _ even his own closest relatives _ to help carry some of his load, but no one will assume even a tiny bit of his burden. In fact, (oh prophet), you can alert (only) those who fear their Lord and establish ´salat´ without having seen Him. Whoever strives to purify his soul, does so for his own good. Towards Allah is (your final) destination"
