We had designated your previous ´Qibla´ _ (the prayer direction) _ as a test: so as to distinguish those of you who follow the messenger, apart from those who turn back on their heels. It was (a choice) difficult (and daunting), except for those whom Allah guided. Allah is not the One to let your faith go to waste. Allah is certainly full of kindness and mercy for mankind"

So, We will divert you (away from the present ´Qibla´) and let you switch to the ´Qibla´ of your liking. (Henceforth, while praying), turn to face the direction of the sacred mosque (at Makkah). Those given the scriptures (earlier) do definitely know that indeed, it is the truth from your Lord. Allah is not unaware of what they do"

Nor do they, (the Christians and the Jews), adopt each other´s ´Qibla´. You would certainly be the evildoer if you followed their whims and wishes, despite the fact that (true) knowledge has definitely come to you"
