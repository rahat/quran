If they come to you and ask you to arbitrate matters concerning them, you may do so, or decline. They cannot harm you a bit if you ignore them. However, if you opt to decide their disputes, then be fair and equitable. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just"

So did the rabbis and the scholars. They were entrusted with the task of preserving the book of Allah. To that fact they are the witnesses! So do not be afraid of people; rather fear Me!\" (Oh Jews), do not trade away My revelations for a paltry price _ (the worldly gain). Those who fail to direct their affairs according to what Allah has revealed, are indeed the unbelievers"

And for wounds inflicted, a fair retaliation is proper (and due). But if the victim forgoes (the right to retaliate), then that act of charity would be the atonement for his sins. Unjust and evil are those who fail to direct their affairs according to what Allah has revealed"
