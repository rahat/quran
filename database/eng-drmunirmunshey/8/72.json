    "text": "Indeed, those who believed, left their homes, and waged a struggle for the cause of Allah as well as those who helped them and gave them shelter are each otherÂ´s friends and allies. But you owe no obligation to those who failed to emigrate (and leave their homes) _ even though they believe _ until they do emigrate. However, if they seek your assistance in matters of faith, then you must help them, except against any nation with whom you have a pact of alliance. Allah (vigilantly) watches everything you do"
