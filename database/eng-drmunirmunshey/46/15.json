    "text": "We have made it incumbent upon man to treat his parents with kindness. His mother carried him with difficulty, and went through labor in pain. The pregnancy and weaning takes a total period of thirty months. Then when he reaches forty years of age and has attained his full strength (and potential), he says, \"My Lord, instill in me the courage to be grateful for the blessings You have showered upon me and my parents. Inspire me to do good deeds _ the deeds that please You. (My Lord) make my offspring righteous. I turn to You in repentance and I am one of those who submit (to Your will)"
