    "text": "Allah has not placed two hearts in any personÂ´s body. He does not render your wife to be like your mother simply because you swear and declare her to be like your mother. He does not consider your adopted sons to be like your own begotten sons. These are mere expressions that escape your lips. Allah declares the truth and guides you on to the (right) path"
