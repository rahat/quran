    "text": "Call your adopted sons by their (real) fathersÂ´ names. That is more upright according to Allah. Should you not know their fathers, then of course, they are your brothers in faith and your companions. What you utter by mistake will not be held against you, unless you assert it consciously from the bottom of your heart. Allah is the oft Forgiving and the most Merciful"
