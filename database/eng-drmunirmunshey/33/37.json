    "text": "And recall that man (Zayd)? Allah had done favors upon him, and you had too. You were saying to him, \"Fear Allah, keep your wife and do not divorce her.\" Allah was going to bring out into the open that which you kept hidden in your heart at that time. You were afraid of people, although that is AllahÂ´s right! You should fear Him only! When Zayd had completed his object (of divorcing his wife), We married her to you. (We did that) so the believers may have no restriction in (and may have no stigma attached to) marrying the former wives of their adopted sons, provided the adopted sons had already divorced their wives. The commands of Allah must be fulfilled"
