    "text": "You will never see it happen, that folks who believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment (also) love those who oppose Allah and His messenger, even if they happen to be their fathers, sons, brothers or other relatives. Such are the believers upon whose hearts Allah has etched faith; He has bolstered their belief with His true guidance and light. He will usher them into paradise, right through which, run rivers. They will live there forever! Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah! Beware, it is (really) the party of Allah that will triumph"
