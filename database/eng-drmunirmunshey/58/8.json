    "text": "Have you not seen those who were forbidden from engaging in intrigues and cabals? Yet they went back to doing (exactly) what they were forbidden (to do). They conspired to commit sins and wrongful acts, and to disobey the messenger. When they visit you, they greet you in a manner in which Allah did not greet you. (Mischievously, they twist words, as they salute you). In their hearts they say, \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" For them, hellfire is enough! They shall burn in it! What a despicable destination"
