    "text": "Allah created you from dust and then from a drop of semen. Then, He fashioned you into one of two sexes _ male and female. No female ever conceives or delivers except with His precise knowledge. The aged man lives that long while the lives of others are curtailed strictly in compliance with His commands prescribed in a book. That is really easy for Allah"
