    "text": "Of course, Allah knows that you, and some of those with you, do stand (in ´salat´) close to two-thirds of the night. Sometimes half the night and sometimes close to one-third (of the night). Allah keeps the count of the day and the night (precisely). He knows that you cannot (always) keep time (so accurately). So He has turned to you with kindness and grace. You may recite as much of the Qur´an as you easily can. He knows that (at any given time) some of you would be sick, and others would be travelling in search of Allah´s bounties. Still others would be (engaged in) fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur´an as you can, establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and advance the virtuous loan to Allah. Whatever good deeds you send ahead for yourself are there with Allah. You will receive the rewards for your deeds (on the Day of Judgment), far better and bigger (than your deeds deserve). Seek the forgiveness of Allah, for Allah is oft-Forgiving, the most Merciful"
