    "text": "Stay away from those who treat their religion as nothing more than play and pastime. The life of this world has (dazzled and) deceived them. By (means of) this (QurÂ´an), call their attention to the fact that the soul is held in pledge against the deed it earns. They have no protector or mediators besides Allah. Absolutely, no ransom of any kind will be accepted in exchange for their deeds. Such ones would be held (responsible) for their deeds. Boiling water will be their drink, and because they used to deny, they will face a painful punishment"
