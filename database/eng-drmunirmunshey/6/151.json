Treat your parents with kindness and courtesy. Do not kill your offspring because of poverty. We shall give you, and them, the provisions (of life). Do not come anywhere close to committing the lewd and lascivious acts _ whether openly or in secret. Do not take a human life _ Allah has deemed the human life to be sacred _ except in the cause and the course of justice. That, He has instructed you! Perhaps, you would understand"
