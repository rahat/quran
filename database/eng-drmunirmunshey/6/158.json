Or any one of the (final and manifest) signs from your Lord to appear? (Professing) belief on the day any such signs appear will not benefit those who had not believed earlier, nor those who had failed to earn any good deeds with their belief. Say to them, \"Go ahead and wait! We too shall wait with you"
