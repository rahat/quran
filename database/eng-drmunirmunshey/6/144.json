    "text": "(Of the remaining four), two are camels _ (male and female), and the other two are cattle_ (the ox and the cow). Ask them, \"Has He, (Allah) forbidden the males of these two species, or the females? And does the ban include the calves being carried by the females in their uterus? Were you really present there when Allah gave those instructions?
