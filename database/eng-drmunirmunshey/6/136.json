    "text": "They assign a share for Allah out of the crops and cattle bestowed upon them by Him. They claim, \"This (share) is for Allah, and that is for our partners (of Allah).\" But seldom does their partners´ share reach Allah. However, Allah´s share frequently ends up with their partners. How despicable are their decisions"
