    "text": "(Oh Muhammad, SAW) say, \"In the revelation sent to me, I find nothing that prohibits anyone from eating anything except: the (unslaughtered) dead animal, blood poured forth (at the time of slaughter), the flesh of swine because it is filthy, and the sinful food presented as an offering to beings, other than Allah. But if one is compelled by dire need _ and not by haughtiness or habit _ then of course Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
