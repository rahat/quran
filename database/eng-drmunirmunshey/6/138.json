No one can eat its (meat, fruit or) produce except whomever we allow.\" They prohibit certain animals to be employed for farm labor (or for burden). On certain other animals they do not invoke AllahÂ´s name (at the time of their slaughter). They invent lies against Him! Soon He will punish them for the falsehood they invent"
