    "text": "If any one of you lacks the means to wed a free believing woman, he may marry a believing woman among those (captives and slaves) your right hand possesses. Allah is well aware of your (state of) belief; you belong to one another. So, marry them with the permission of their family. Pay the women their ´mehar´ _ (nuptial dowry) _ according to the customary manner. Let the women enter into wedlock, and not have illegal sexual liaisons, nor have secret paramours. After entering into wedlock, if such women commit a salacious act, (adultery), their punishment would be half of the punishment a free woman (committing the same offense) would receive. This (exemption of marrying captive women) is for the one who fears distress (from a lack of self-restraint). However, it is better for you to be patient and restrain yourself. Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful"
