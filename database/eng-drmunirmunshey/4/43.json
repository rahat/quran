    "text": "Oh you who believe! Do not come near ´salat´ if you are drunk, until you know what you utter. Nor if you are spiritually unclean (after a sexual contact) _ unless you are traveling _ until you (bathe and) clean yourself. If you are sick or traveling, or if any of you has been to the toilet, or if you have come in (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water (to clean yourself), then perform ´Tayyamum´. Find a clean slab of soil and (after touching it) run your hand over your face and hands. Indeed, Allah is Lenient and Merciful"
