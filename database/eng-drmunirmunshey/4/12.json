    "text": "Your share is half of what your wives leave behind, provided they have no child. If they have children, then your share is a quarter of what they leave behind, after paying off any legacy bequeathed, and debt incurred. Your widowsÂ´ share is a quarter of what you leave behind, provided you have no children. But if you have children, then their share is an eighth of what you leave behind, after paying off any legacy bequeathed, and debt incurred. If the deceased _ man or woman _ is not survived by any children or parent, but has a brother and a sister, then each of them would inherit a sixth. Should there be more than two (siblings), then they shall share equally in a third, after paying any legacy bequeathed, and debts incurred. (Let there be) no harm (to the heirs). These are instructions from Allah! And Allah is all-Aware, and the most Forbearing"
