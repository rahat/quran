    "text": "Aren´t you aware of those who were told to restrain their hands _ (keep from fighting), to establish ´salat´, and to pay the ´zakat´? (Later) when fighting was enjoined upon them, some of them have begun to fear people like they should fear Allah. In fact, (their fear of people is) even more than (their) fear of Allah. They say, \"Our lord! Why did You enjoin fighting upon us? Why did You not give us a respite for a little while longer?\" Say, \"Brief are the comforts of this life! The life-to-come is better indeed for those who do their duty! You will not be wronged at all _ not even worth a fibril upon a date-stone"
