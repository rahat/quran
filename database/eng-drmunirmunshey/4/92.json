    "text": "It is not (conceivable) for a believer to kill another believer _ unless it was (unintended, accidental or) by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by (accident or) mistake must set free a believing slave (as a penance), and must pay blood money as compensation to the family of the deceased _ unless the family waives (the blood money) out of charity. If the deceased belonged to a nation at war with you and was also a believer, then the penance shall be the freeing of a believing slave, (but no blood money). If the believing deceased belonged to a nation with whom you have a pact of alliance, then the penance involves payment of blood money to the family (of the believing deceased), in addition to the freeing of the believing slave. The one who does not find (the financial means) must observe fasts daily for two consecutive months to seek forgiveness from Allah. Of course, Allah is all-Knowing and the Wisest"
