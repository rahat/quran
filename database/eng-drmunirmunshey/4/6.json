    "text": "Keep testing the orphans till they reach the marriageable age. If you perceive them to be of sound judgment, then turn their assets over to them. Do not squander and waste the wealth in haste, lest they grow up (and demand their inheritance). The rich guardian should not charge (for managing the assets of the orphan). The poor guardian may have for himself a (reasonable and) customary share. When you turn their assets over to the orphans, arrange to have others witness (the transfer). Though, Allah is enough to take account"
