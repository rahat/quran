    "text": "The two are not equal: those who sit at home (and do not join the fighting) _ unless they have a reason; they are handicapped _ and those who strive hard in the path of Allah with their wealth and lives. Over those who sit at home, Allah has excelled and elevated to a higher honor those who strive hard with their wealth and lives. Compared to those who sit at home, Allah will award a far greater reward to those who wage a struggle"
