    "text": "Oh you who believe! When you go out (to fight) in the path of Allah, make a distinction (between friends and foes). If someone wishes you the greeting of Islam, do not _ seeking the benefits of this world _ be quick and say, \"You are not the believer.\" Allah has the most abundant booty and benefits for you. In fact, you were like that once, but Allah bestowed His favors upon you. Therefore, (verify and) ascertain the facts first. Indeed, Allah is very well Aware of everything you do"
