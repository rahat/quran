    "text": "There are some (hypocrites) who are waiting to see your fate. If victory comes to you from Allah, they will say to you, \"Were we not with you?\" However, if fate favored the unbelievers, they will say to them, \"Could we not have (fought against you and) overwhelmed you? DidnÂ´t we keep the believers from (defeating) you?\" Allah will render his judgment between you (and them) on the Day of Judgment. Allah will never allow the unbelievers a way over the believers"
