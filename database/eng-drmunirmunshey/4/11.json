    "text": "Allah gives you instructions concerning (the inheritance of) your children. The male has a share equal to the shares of two females. If there are two or more daughters (and no sons), then they shall equally share two-thirds of what is left behind. Should there be only one daughter, she would inherit half. If the deceased left children, each (living) parent of the deceased shall receive one sixth of the inheritance. If the deceased left no children, and the parents are the only heirs, then the mother gets a third; and if (the parents are not the only heirs and) the deceased has brothers, then the mother inherits a sixth. (The proceeds in every case are) after paying off any legacy bequeathed, and debt incurred. You do not know which of the two deserves to benefit more from you _ your parents, or your children. (These fixed shares are) ordained by Allah! Of course, Allah is the all-Knowing, and the Wisest"
