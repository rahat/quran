    "text": "Oh People of the book! Do not (overstate and) exaggerate your religious beliefs; do not say anything except the truth about Allah. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary was in fact (nothing more than) the messenger of Allah and His word which He cast upon Mary. (Jesus was) a soul created by Him. So, believe in Allah and His messenger. Do not say (that Allah is) three! Desist! It is better for you (if you desist). Verily, Allah is (only) One. He is (too glorified and) too exalted to have a son. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. Allah suffices as a Disposer of all matters and things! (He needs no mediator)"
