Nor (is it proper or lawful) to take back anything you gave her (as a gift) _ unless she commits an openly lewd and salacious act (an extra marital sexual act). Associate with her in an honorable manner. You may dislike her. Yet, it is possible that you may dislike something, though Allah may have placed in it a great deal of good"
