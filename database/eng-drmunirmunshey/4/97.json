    "text": "There are those who have wrought a wrong upon themselves (by not migrating with the prophet, as ordered). The angels (of death), would take possession of their souls and ask, \"What was wrong with you?\" They would answer, \"We were too weak and oppressed in the land!\" The angels will say, \"WasnÂ´t the land of Allah vast and spacious enough, so you could emigrate (and seek refuge) elsewhere?\" Such ones would have an abode in hell. What a despicable destination"
