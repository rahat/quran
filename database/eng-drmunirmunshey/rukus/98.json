The penance for anyone of you who hunts (during ´Ihram´) is an offering at the Kaaba similar to what was killed _ as judged by two just men among you. The atonement (for that act) is the feeding of the poor, or fasting for an equivalent number of days, so he may taste the consequence of his evil act. Allah forgives whatever has happened in the past, but He will exact retribution if anyone repeats (the offense). Allah is the most Powerful; He is the Lord of Revenge"
