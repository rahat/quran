Should you be in doubt about the resurrection, consider this: it is We Who created you (first) from dust and then (in stages) from semen to a clinging clot of blood, and then to a small chunk of flesh _ formed as well as unformed. (We tell you this) in order to explain to you the truth. In the womb, We keep installed whomever We want for a fixed time. Then, We bring you out as an infant, and let you obtain your full potential. Some of you die young while others are diverted to the age of weakness (and senility) _ the age when (once again) they know nothing after having learnt a few things. You observe the land dry and barren. Then, as soon as We send rain water down (it comes alive), it stirs, swells up and starts producing all sorts of delightful vegetation"
