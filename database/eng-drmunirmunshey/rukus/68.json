If you are sick or traveling, or if any of you has been to the toilet, or if you have come in (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water (to clean yourself), then perform ´Tayyamum´. Find a clean slab of soil and (after touching it) run your hand over your face and hands. Indeed, Allah is Lenient and Merciful"

They pretend to say, ´we heard and we obeyed´, and ´wait, we did not hear´. Instead, with a twist of their tongue, they make it sound (as if they said), \"We heard and we disobeyed\", and \"Listen, may you go deaf!\" and ´Raina´ _ (an insult in Hebrew). Thus, they slander the (true) faith. It would have been much better for them and more upright, had they said, \"We heard and we obey\" and \"Listen to us, and be patient with us\". Because of their disbelief, Allah has cursed them! Little is what they believe"
