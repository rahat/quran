Let the mother not suffer (unduly) because of her child, nor the father on account of his child. The heirs carry the same liability (as that of the father). There is no harm if both (parents), after mutual consultation and consent, want the infant weaned. There is (also) no harm if you decide to hire a wet-nurse to suckle the child, provided you pay her what is due in an accepted manner. Fear Allah, and know (for sure) that Allah (vigilantly) watches over everything you do"
