They spy for others who do not come to you. They (misquote you and) change the words out of context. (To their followers) they say, \"Accede and accept if you are told such and such, and be weary if you are told anything different.\" You (Oh Muhammad, SAW) have no authority at all to help the one whom Allah wants to (tempt and) test through an ordeal. They are among those whose hearts Allah has chosen not to cleanse and purify. Disgrace (and defeat) is their lot in this world, and in the life-to-come they shall face the severest (most awful) punishment"
