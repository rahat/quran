If a man passes away and has no (living parent or) child, but has a sister, then she inherits half of what he leaves behind. (Similarly) he would inherit from his sister, if she was childless. If a man was survived by two sisters (and no direct heir) they both would inherit two-thirds of what he leaves behind. If the deceased had (no direct heirs, but) brothers and sisters, then the share of the male shall be equal to the share of two females. Allah clarifies matters for you, lest you go astray. Allah is very well Aware of all things"
