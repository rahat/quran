Whoever among you lives to see that month, must observe fasts (during that month). Whoever among you is sick or on a journey, (must fast) the same number of other days. Allah wants to make matters easy for you; He does not want to impose hardships on you. So complete the period (of fasting). Glorify Allah (and thank Him) for the guidance He has granted.

Of course, Allah knows that you (had succumbed to desire and) were cheating yourself (by engaging in sexual activity during the nights of fasting). He has accepted your repentance and has pardoned you. Now, you may have (social and sexual) relations with your wives (during the night of fasting). Seek from their company that _ (peace and progeny) _ which Allah has ordained for you. (You may) eat and drink until the white streak (of dawn) becomes visible (on the horizon) against the darkness. Thereafter, complete the fast till nightfall. Do not have (sexual) contact with your wives when you confine yourself in a mosque (to worship). These are the bounds of Allah. Do not approach them (much less exceed them). Thus, Allah makes His revelations manifestly clear for mankind. Perhaps, you would fear (Allah) and attain piety"
