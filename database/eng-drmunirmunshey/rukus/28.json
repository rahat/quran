But according to Allah, far worse is preventing people from the path of Allah, rejecting Him and (blocking access to) the sacred House of worship, and the ousting of its occupants. Corruption (and oppression) is (far) more serious than bloodshed. They will not cease to engage you in combat, till they turn you away from your faith, if they (ever) can. Those who abandon the (true) faith and die as unbelievers, would lose (the worth of) all their (good) deeds in this world and the life-to-come. They are the inmates of the fire, and there, they shall abide forever"
