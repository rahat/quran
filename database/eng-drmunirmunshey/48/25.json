    "text": "It is they, the unbelievers, who prevented you from reaching the Holy mosque and prevented the animals pledged for sacrifice from reaching the site of the sacrificial slaughter. But, there were believing men and women in their midst whom you did not know. Unwittingly, you would have killed them, and unknowingly you would have suffered the sin (of having killed the believers). Therefore, Allah restrained your hands, so that He might admit into His mercy whomever He wants. Had they (the believing men and women) stood apart, We would have punished the disbelievers with the painful punishment"
