    "text": "What if the mountains move about, the earth rips open and the dead begin talking? What if the Quran were to cause all that? (They would still not believe). Indeed, the power and prerogative of all sorts belong to Allah! Do the believers not feel reassured by the fact that Allah, if He had wanted, could bestow guidance upon all people. As a consequence of their lies, calamity would continue to hit them in their homes, or strike nearby, till the day of His promise. Surely, Allah does not renege on His promise"
