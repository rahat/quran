    "text": "Do you not see that Allah sends water down from the sky? Then, He channels it into rivers and springs across the earth, and produces with it vegetation of all different (kinds and) colors. But then it withers and you see it fade and (turn) yellow. Later, He turns it into chaff. Indeed, there is a lesson in it for any sensible person"
