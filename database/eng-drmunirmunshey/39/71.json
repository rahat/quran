As the gates of hell open, the keepers (of hell) would ask, \"Had the messengers from amongst your own (people) not come to (warn) you? DidnÂ´t they recite to you the verses of your Lord, warning you about the encounters of this day?\" They will reply, \"Yes (they did)!\" The sentence of torment is (fair and) justified for the unbelievers"
