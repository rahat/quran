    "text": "Allah has revealed the very best of the narrative. The oft-repeated contents of this book are coherent, consistent and coupled _ (the promise of rewards is coupled with the threat of punishment). Those who fear their Lord are awestruck by it. Their flesh shudders with fright, and their hearts and souls become mellow with the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah! He guides whomever He wants! There is no guide for the one whom Allah leads astray"
