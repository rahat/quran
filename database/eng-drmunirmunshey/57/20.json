    "text": "You should know that the life of this world is (nothing but) fun and games _ merely play and pastime. (It consists of) the bragging and boasting among you about the adornments and embellishments (of your existence), and the abundance of your wealth and children. It is just like the shower of rain, which causes lush green (fields) that please the tillers. (But) later on, it dries up and you see it turn pale and become chaff. In the life-to-come, there is severe punishment (for the unbelievers), and forgiveness from Allah and His acceptance (for the believers). The life of this world is (nothing but) an illusive deception _ a brief enjoyment"
