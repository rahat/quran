    "text": "He it is, Who sends winds bearing the glad tidings of His approaching mercy. We direct the wind heavy with rainclouds towards the dead and barren land, and We call water to pour down upon it. We bring out (from that land) all sorts of food with that water. In much the same manner, We will bring the dead back to life. Perhaps, you would bear that in mind"
