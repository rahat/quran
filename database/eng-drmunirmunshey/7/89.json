    "text": "If we returned to your religion, we would have invented a lie against Allah, particularly since He it is, Who saved us from it. By no means will we return to your religion, unless of course Allah, our Lord wills it so. Our Lord has full knowledge of every single thing. We do place our trust in Allah. Our Lord! Give Your just verdict (in the matter) between our nation and us. You are the Best of the judges"
