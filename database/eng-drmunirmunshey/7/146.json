    "text": "I shall divert and drive away from My signs those who _ without any reason or right _ behave in a haughty and arrogant manner in this world. They will not believe though they may witness every single sign (and proof). When they see the road to righteousness, they fail to follow it, but when they see a way that is decadent or deviant, they adopt it as their own way (right away). This is because they rejected Our signs and were unmindful of them"
