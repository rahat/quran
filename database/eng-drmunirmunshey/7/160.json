    "text": "We split them into twelve distinct clans. When his people asked for water We inspired Musa, \"Strike that rock with your staff!\" As a result, twelve springs gushed forth from it, and each tribe then knew the place of its water. We provided the cover of clouds for them (in the desert), and We sent forth for them (from the sky) _ ´the manna´ and ´the salwa´. (We said), \"Eat the pure wholesome things We give you.\" They did not harm Us a bit; rather, (by being ungrateful) they used to inflict harm upon themselves"
