    "text": "Oh children of Adam! Do not let Shaitan entice you as he did your (primordial) parents when he got them expelled from paradise. He stripped them of their clothes, in order to expose their nakedness to them. Of course, Shaitan and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them. Of course, We let the Shaitans be the friends of those who do not believe"
