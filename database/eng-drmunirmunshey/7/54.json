    "text": "Your Lord, Allah, is certainly the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time. Then He mounted the throne (majestically). He wrapped the night over the day that follows it quickly. The sun, the moon and the stars have all been tamed by His command. Beware! The creation and the command (over it), belong to Him (exclusively). Exalted is He, the Sustainer of all the worlds"
