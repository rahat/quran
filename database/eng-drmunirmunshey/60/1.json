    "text": "Oh those of you who believe, if you (really) left your homes for Me, seeking My approval, then do not accept My enemies _ and your enemies _ as friends! You show them affection, even though they have rejected the truth that came to you! They exiled the messenger _ and you, too _ because you believe in Allah, your Lord. You secretly show them affection! I know what you conceal and what you declare! Whoever amongst you does that, has really left the straight path and has gone astray"
