    "text": "Oh those of you who believe, investigate (all) immigrant women who come to you, claiming to be the believers. Allah knows better, whether or not they believe. If you determine that they (really) are the believers, then do not repatriate them back to their non-believing husbands (or family). The believing women are not lawful for the non-believing men; nor are the non-believing men lawful for the believing women. Return to their non-believing husbands whatever they had spent (as nuptial dowry). You would not be committing a sin, if you marry such women, provided you pay them their due. Do not keep the non-believing women married to you. Ask them to return what you had spent upon them (as nuptial dowry). Let the non-believing husbands (likewise) receive the amounts they had spent on their (believing) wives. This is the command of Allah! He judges between you; Allah is the all-Knowing, the Wisest"
