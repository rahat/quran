Such is their description in the Torah. About them, the Gospel quotes the parable, \"It is as if the seed is sown in the field. In time it sprouts and sends up a tiny green shoot. Then, it becomes strong and stout, and stands on its stalk. It delights the sower and enrages the unbelievers.\" Allah promises forgiveness and a tremendous reward to those of the believers who perform the righteous deeds"
