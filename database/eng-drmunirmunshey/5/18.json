    "text": "(Both) the Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of Allah and we are dearer to Him than all others.\" Ask them, \"Then, why does He punish you (and makes you pay) for your sins. In fact, you are humans like all others He has created. He forgives whom He wants, and He punishes whom He wants! To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and everything else between them. Towards Him is the final return (of all beings)"
