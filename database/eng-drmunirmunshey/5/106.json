If you find death close at hand, and you want to make out your last will, appoint as witnesses, two just men among you _ or among other people, should the calamity strike while you happen to be traveling. If you are in doubt (about the witnesses) detain them after ´salat´ and let them swear by Allah saying, \"We will not trade our testimony for worldly gain, nor will we hide the testimony of Allah. Else we would be the sinners"
