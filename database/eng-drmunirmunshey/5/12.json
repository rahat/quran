    "text": "Allah certainly had the (sacred) covenant with the children of Israel. And We had appointed twelve (tribes and twelve) leaders among them. Allah said, \"I will be with you, provided you establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, believe in My messengers and honor and assist them, and advance a (sincere) virtuous loan to Allah. I will rid you of your sins (and your faults and flaws). I will certainly usher you into paradise through which run the rivers. If, despite the covenant, anyone of you disbelieves, then he will definitely go astray and deviate from the straight path of piety and righteousness"
