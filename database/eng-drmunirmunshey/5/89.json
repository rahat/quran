    "text": "Allah will not hold you responsible for whatever is not meant or deliberate in your oaths. But He will take you to task for whatever you swear to and pledge in earnest. The penalty for that, (breaking your pledge), consists of either the feeding of ten poor people with the food you would give your own family on an average (day), or providing them with clothing; or the freeing of a slave. The one who cannot afford any of that, may observe fasts for three days. That is the atonement for breaching your sworn pledges. So observe and abide by your oaths. Thus, Allah makes His message manifest for you, so you would be grateful"
