    "text": "Those who said that the Messiah, (Jesus), son of Mary is God Himself (or god incarnate) have indeed committed a sacrilege. Say, \"Does anyone possess even a bit of power to do anything against Allah? What if He wants to destroy the Messiah, (Jesus) son of Mary, his mother and all the living beings on the surface of the earth? The heavens and the earth and all else in between belong to Allah. He creates what He wills, and Allah is able to will everything"
