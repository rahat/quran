    "text": "In the Torah, We had prescribed for them (the principle): A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth. And for wounds inflicted, a fair retaliation is proper (and due). But if the victim forgoes (the right to retaliate), then that act of charity would be the atonement for his sins. Unjust and evil are those who fail to direct their affairs according to what Allah has revealed"
