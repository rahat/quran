    "text": "This day all wholesome things are made lawful for you. The food of the people of the scriptures is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. Permissible for you are the chaste believing women and the chaste women of the people of the scriptures _ to enter into wedlock, not illegal sexual liaisons (secret or otherwise) or as intimate female companions (girlfriends) _ provided you give them their nuptial dues. Fruitless are the deeds of anyone who denies faith. In the life-to-come, he will be the loser"
