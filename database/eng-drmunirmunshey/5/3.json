    "text": "Forbidden for you (to eat) are (unslaughtered) dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine and animals slaughtered in the name of beings other than Allah. (Also forbidden are) animals that die as a result of strangulation, violent blows or fall from a height, as well as animals gored to death or (partially) eaten by wild beasts _ unless you salvage (and slaughter) them (before they die). Also forbidden are animals slaughtered before idols, altars and monuments (dedicated to beings other than Allah) as well as meat distributed by resorting to raffle. These are sins. Today, the unbelievers have given up hope about (wishing) your faith (away). Do not fear them; fear me! I have this day perfected your way of life for you, and I have completed My favor upon you. I have chosen Islam _ (submission) _ to be your religion. If one is compelled by hunger (to eat the forbidden food) _ and not by a desire to deviate and debauch _ then of course Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
