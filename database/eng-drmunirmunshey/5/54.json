    "text": "Oh you, the believers! If anyone of you forsakes (and renounces) his faith, (he should know that) Allah will soon bring another people (in your place). Those whom He loves, and who would love Him! They would be lenient and tolerant towards the believers, and stern and unyielding with the unbelievers. They would strive their utmost for the cause of Allah, and would not fear the censure of the critics and the faultfinders. Such is the grace of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills. Allah is Boundless and Infinite, and all-Knowing"
