    "text": "And, (Oh Muhammad, SAW) We have revealed to you the truth in this book _ (the QurÂ´an). It confirms the scriptures that were (revealed) before it, and it supercedes them. So judge between them according to what Allah has revealed to you. Do not deviate from the truth that has come to you, by yielding to their whims and wishes. For each (of the three groups) we laid down the law and a prescribed program. Had Allah wanted, He could have made you (all) into a single nation. But (He did not), so He may test you all according to what He has granted you. So rush towards _ and compete with each other for _ the righteous deeds. Towards Allah shall you all return! Then, He will tell you about all that you used to dispute"
