    "text": "Surely, it was We Who revealed the Torah with its guidance and the light. The prophets _ all of whom had submitted (to the will of Allah) _ judged the Jews according to it. So did the rabbis and the scholars. They were entrusted with the task of preserving the book of Allah. To that fact they are the witnesses! So do not be afraid of people; rather fear Me!\" (Oh Jews), do not trade away My revelations for a paltry price _ (the worldly gain). Those who fail to direct their affairs according to what Allah has revealed, are indeed the unbelievers"
