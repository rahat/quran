    "text": "Oh you who believe! Do not violate the sacred rituals of Allah: the sacred (months of pilgrimage), the sacrificial animals, the garlanded animals pledged as offerings, and the people flocking the sacred house seeking the grace and approval of their Lord. You may hunt once you take off the ´ihram´ _ the ritual attire of pilgrimage. Do not let your hatred (and prejudice) against a nation _ a nation that once forbade you to enter the sacred mosque _ cause you to become unjust and commit excesses. Assist and support each other in matters of virtue and piety. Do not help each other in sin and transgression. Fear Allah! Allah is very severe in (inflicting) punishment"
