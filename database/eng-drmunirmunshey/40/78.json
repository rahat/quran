    "text": "Indeed, We sent (many) messengers before you. We have narrated to you the tales of some of them, and We have told you nothing about the others. Without the permission of Allah (and of his own accord) no messenger could ever perform any miracles. (In the case of all the messengers), once the order came from Allah, the matter was settled with total justice. Those insisting upon falsehood incurred a total loss at that time"
