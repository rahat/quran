    "text": "It is He Who created you first from dust and then from a drop (of semen), and then from a clot of blood. He brought you out as (a weak and helpless) infant. Then, (He lets you grow) so you may achieve your full potential. (He lets you live further) so that you may reach an advanced old age. (He causes) some of you to die prematurely! (All this is done) so you may reach the appointed time (set by Him), and so that you may understand (the reality of life)"
