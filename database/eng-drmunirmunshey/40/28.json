    "text": "A man from the nation of pharaoh, who was a believer and was hiding his faith, said, \"Would you kill a man just because he asserts that Allah is his Lord? He has brought you clear proofs from your Lord! Should he be a liar, let his lie be upon his conscience. But if he happens to be truthful, then you might suffer from some of the things with which he has threatened you! Indeed, Allah does not guide a liar and a transgressor"
