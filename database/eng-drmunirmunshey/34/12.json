    "text": "And to Sulaiman (We granted control over) the wind. (Harnessing that control) he could cover the distance of a monthÂ´s journey during the run of the wind in just one morning; and come back during the course of the wind in the evening. We caused a stream of copper to gush forth for him. By the will of Allah, the jinn worked under his supervision. Whenever a jinn ignored the command and turned away from his job, We made that jinn taste the torment of the blazing fire"
