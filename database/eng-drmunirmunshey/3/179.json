    "text": "Allah is not going to leave the believers in the (same) state they are in. He will (sift, sieve and) set apart the wicked from the virtuous. Allah will not disclose the unseen (mysteries of the universe) to them (individually). For that, Allah selects messengers from among them, whomever He wants. So, believe in Allah and His messenger. You shall have a gracious reward, if you believe (in Allah) and fear (Him)"
