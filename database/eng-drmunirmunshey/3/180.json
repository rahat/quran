    "text": "There are those who stingily cling to what Allah bestows upon them by His grace. (They donÂ´t give charity). Let them not think that it is good for them. In fact, it is woeful (and perilous) for them. On the Day of Judgment, they would be strapped and shackled (around the neck) by that which they (now) hoard (so eagerly). The heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah; and Allah is well Aware of everything you do"
