    "text": "Among the people of the scriptures are some who would readily return (your trust) to you, even if you entrust them with a lot of money. Among them are also those who would not pay you back, even if you entrusted him with a single ´dinar´, unless you stand over them (and demand it) constantly. This is so, because they say, \"There is no liability upon us about matters concerning the illiterate _ (the non-jews).\" They deliberately utter lies about Allah"
