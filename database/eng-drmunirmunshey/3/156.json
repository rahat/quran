    "text": "Oh you who believe! Do not be like the unbelievers. About their brothers who travel in the land or go into battle, they say, \"Had they been with us they would not have died. They would not have been killed. \" Allah has let such notions be the source of (sorrow and) a bewailing (mournful) lament in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives life and death! And Allah watches everything you do"
