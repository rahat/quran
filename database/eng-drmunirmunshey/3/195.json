I will surely cleanse the offenses committed by those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes _ those who were (harassed and) persecuted in My cause; (those who) fought and were slain (for My sake). I will definitely admit them into the gardens (of paradise) through which run the rivers. (That is) the reward from Allah; and Allah has the most excellent rewards"
