    "text": "As a messenger to the children of Israel (he will say), \"I have brought you the proof from your Lord. Out of clay, I fashion the figure of a bird and by Allah´s leave, it turns into a (real) bird when I blow into it. By Allah´s leave, I cure those who are blind by birth, and the lepers. I bring the dead (back) to life by Allah´s leave. I inform you of that which you eat, and of that which you store up in your homes. Surely, in that is a definite proof for you, if you are the believers"
