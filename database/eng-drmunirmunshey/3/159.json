    "text": "It is because of the mercy of Allah that you, (Oh Muhammad, SAW), are lenient (and polite) with them. For, had you been callous and hard of heart, they would have (disbanded and) dispersed from around you. So, pardon them, seek forgiveness for them and seek their advice in matters (that concern them). Then, once you arrive at a decision, put your trust in Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who place their trust (in Him)"
