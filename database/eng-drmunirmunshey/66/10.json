    "text": "For the unbelievers, Allah cites the case of the wives of the prophets ´Nooh´ and ´Loot´. They were married to two of Our most honorable and righteous servants. But they betrayed their husbands, and so their husbands could not help them against Allah at all. Both of these women were ordered to enter the hellfire just like all the others who (deserved to enter hell, and) would live there for ever"
