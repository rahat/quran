Baring those already mentioned, all other women are lawful for you, provided you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, and not for illegal sexual liaison. Pay the women you marry, their ´mehar´ _ (nuptial dowry) _ as a sacred trust. You bear no blame if you pay the ´mehar´ and later agree upon something else (about the dowry) with mutual consent. Indeed Allah is the all-Knowing and the Wisest"

Allah is well aware of your (state of) belief; you belong to one another. So, marry them with the permission of their family. Pay the women their ´mehar´ _ (nuptial dowry) _ according to the customary manner. Let the women enter into wedlock, and not have illegal sexual liaisons, nor have secret paramours. After entering into wedlock, if such women commit a salacious act, (adultery), their punishment would be half of the punishment a free woman (committing the same offense) would receive. This (exemption of marrying captive women) is for the one who fears distress (from a lack of self-restraint). However, it is better for you to be patient and restrain yourself. Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful"
