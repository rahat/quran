Rather, pious is he who believes (firmly) in Allah, the last day, the angels, the scriptures, and the prophets. (Pious is he, who) spends his wealth (in charity) _ out of love for Him _ on his kinsfolk, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer. (Pious is the one who) gives (help) to those who ask (for help), and (spends money) to free slaves. And (pious are those who) establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, and fulfill the pledges made by them. Those who endure and display fortitude during poverty and adversity, and during times of crises. Such are the people who are sincere! Such are the pious ones"

If the offender receives forgiveness from the victim´s brother (and guardian), then compliance of (the rules of) blood money and a fair award to the victim´s family is obligatory.

He has accepted your repentance and has pardoned you. Now, you may have (social and sexual) relations with your wives (during the night of fasting). Seek from their company that _ (peace and progeny) _ which Allah has ordained for you. (You may) eat and drink until the white streak (of dawn) becomes visible (on the horizon) against the darkness. Thereafter, complete the fast till nightfall. Do not have (sexual) contact with your wives when you confine yourself in a mosque (to worship). These are the bounds of Allah.
