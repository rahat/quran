    "text": "Allah has certainly purchased from the believers their life and their wealth in return for paradise. They fight for the sake of Allah; they slay and are slain. It is a (firm and) binding promise made by Him, and repeated in the Torah, the Gospels and the QurÂ´an. And who could be truer to his promise than Allah? So be happy with the bargain you have just transacted. That, indeed, is the tremendous triumph"
