    "text": "Allah also forgives the three whose matter had been delayed. The earth with all its vastness had closed in on them. Even their own life became utterly constrained, and they realized that they had nowhere to turn except towards Allah. Then, Allah turned to them with kindness, so that they may turn to Him with repentance. Certainly, it is Allah Who accepts repentance; He is the most Merciful"
