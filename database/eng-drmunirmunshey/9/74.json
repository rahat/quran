    "text": "The hypocrites swear by Allah that they have said nothing (wrong); but surely they did utter the words of disbelief. After accepting Islam they have disbelieved! They attempted to do what they could not carry out. How hostile (and resentful) are they, simply because Allah, by His grace and through His messenger, enriched them! It would be to their advantage if they repented. However, if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world, as well as in the life-to-come. They do not have any friends or helpers in this world"
