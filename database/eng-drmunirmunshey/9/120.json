    "text": "It was not proper for the people of ´Al-Medina´, and the Bedouin Arabs living nearby, to lag behind (and abandon) the messenger of Allah. Nor (was it proper for them) to care for their own life more than the life of the messenger. This is so, because whatever actions they undertake (for Allah) _ whether they endure thirst, fatigue and hunger for the sake of Allah or take measure that infuriate the unbelievers, or inflict damage upon the enemy _ is recorded to their credit as virtuous deeds. Of course Allah does not waste the rewards of the righteous"
