    "text": "´Nasi´, (the postponement of the sacred months) is another instance (and example) of disbelief, (a practice) by which the unbelievers are led further astray. They deem a month ´not sacred´ one year and declare it to be sacred the next, in order to make up the numbers of sacred months (in a year). Thus, they (find a way to) legitimize what Allah has forbidden. Such an evil course seems pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"
