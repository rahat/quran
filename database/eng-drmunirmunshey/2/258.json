    "text": "Are you not aware of the person _ (the emperor)_ who argued with Ibraheem about his Lord, (simply) because Allah had granted him an empire. Ibraheem said to him, \"My Lord is the One Who grants life and gives death.\" (The emperor) said, \"I, too, give life and death.\" Ibraheem said, \"In fact, Allah it is, Who causes the sun to rise from the east. You cause it to rise from the west (if you can).\" Thus, the one who disbelieved was left perplexed and speechless. Allah does not guide the nation of wrong doers"
