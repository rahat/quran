    "text": "Allah! There is no god but He! He is the Eternal and the Ever-living! Neither drowsiness, nor sleep ever seizes Him! Everything in the heavens and everything on the earth belongs to Him. Who can dare intercede in His presence except by His leave? He knows everything that lies ahead of them and everything that is behind them.

Preserving and protecting them does not tire (or burden) Him (in the least). He is the most High, the Greatest"
