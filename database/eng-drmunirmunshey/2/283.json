    "text": "If you happen to be traveling, and cannot find a scribe, then you may pledge (or pawn) goods in hand (for cash). If one of you trusts another (with any matter), then he who is trusted should (fulfill his pledge and) discharge the trust faithfully. He should fear Allah, his Lord, and not hide (any of) the evidence. Whoever hides evidence surely has a sinful heart. Allah has full knowledge of every single thing you do"
