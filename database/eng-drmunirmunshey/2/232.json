    "text": "Once you have divorced your wives and they have completed the prescribed term (of waiting), then do not prevent them from taking (other prospective) husbands. (The two may wed) in an accepted manner, provided there is a mutual consent. The one who believes in Allah and the Day of Judgment is (hereby) being admonished. It is closer to piety, and closer to purity. Allah knows it (all), and you know nothing (at all)"
