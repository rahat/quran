    "text": "Thus, We have made you a balanced (and upright) nation; so you may be the witness over mankind, and the messenger would be the witness over you. We had designated your previous ´Qibla´ _ (the prayer direction) _ as a test: so as to distinguish those of you who follow the messenger, apart from those who turn back on their heels. It was (a choice) difficult (and daunting), except for those whom Allah guided. Allah is not the One to let your faith go to waste. Allah is certainly full of kindness and mercy for mankind"
