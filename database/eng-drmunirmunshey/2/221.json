    "text": "(Oh believers), do not marry the unbelieving idolatrous women, unless they believe. A believing slave girl is better than any polytheist woman, no matter how pleasing (and appealing) she may seem to you. Do not marry (your daughters to) the idolatrous men unless they believe. A believing slave is better than a polytheist man, no matter how appealing he may appear to you. They call you towards the fire, while Allah invites you towards paradise and forgiveness by His leave. He makes His verses clear for the people. Perhaps you would bear in mind"
