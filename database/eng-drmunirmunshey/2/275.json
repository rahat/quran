    "text": "(On the Day of Judgment), those who take (the income from) interest and usury would not (be able to) stand straight. (When resurrected), they would stand like a crazed and confounded man _ as if Shaitan had touched and afflicted them. That is because they say, \"Usury (and interest) is just like (the profit from) commerce.\" But Allah has permitted (the profit from) commerce, and He has prohibited interest (and usury). Whoever stops (taking interest) after he receives admonition from his Lord, will not be punished for his past actions. His matter rests with Allah. But those who persist shall be the inmates of the fire. There, they shall stay forever"
