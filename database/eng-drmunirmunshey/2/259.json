    "text": "Just as the case of the man who passed by (the ruins of) a town that lay upside down on its roofs. He said (to himself), \"How will Allah bring the people of this town back to life after death?\" Thereby, Allah let him die (and stay dead) for a hundred years. Then, He brought him back to life and asked him, \"How long did you stay (dead)?\" The man replied, \"I stayed a day or perhaps a part of it.\" (Allah) said, \"In fact, you have stayed (in this state) a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink. It hasnÂ´t become stale at all. Now, look at your donkey. We will turn you into a sign for (other) people. Look at the bones and watch how We gather them all together; then watch how We clothe them with flesh.\" As the reality became evident to him, he remarked,\"I know now that Allah is capable of doing all things"
