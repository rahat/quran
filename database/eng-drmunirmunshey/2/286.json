    "text": "Allah does not burden any soul beyond its endurance. For it is what it earns, and against it is what it commits. \"Our Lord, do not condemn us for what we forget, or err. Our Lord, do not levy upon us the (kind of) burden You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, do not impose upon us a burden that is greater than our strength to withstand. Pardon us, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector! Grant us victory over the nation of unbelievers"
