    "text": "Carry out and conclude (the rites of) Hajj _ (the pilgrimage), or the ´umrah´ _ (the visit); do so for the sake of Allah. If you are held back (by circumstances), then make an offering you can afford with ease. Do not shave off your head (the last of the rituals of Hajj or Umrah) till the offering has reached its destination. The one who is sick, or suffers from an affliction of the scalp, may redeem himself by fasting, giving alms, or making an offering. When you are safe (and in Makkah), and anyone wishes to perform the ´umrah´ before (it is time for) Hajj, he should make an offering he can afford with ease. But if he cannot afford to make an offering, he should fast three days during Hajj, and seven days when he returns (home). That makes ten days of fasting in all. This applies to the one whose family is not present at the Holy house of worship. Fear Allah, and know (for sure) that Allah is indeed very severe in (inflicting) punishment"
