    "text": "And if you divorce your wives before having (sexual) contact, but after settling (the amount of) the nuptial premium, then you are liable to pay half of the stipulated amount. (However), there is no harm if the woman gives up her half, or (there is no harm if the groom,) the one who is responsible for tying the wedding knot (pays the full amount and) waives his half. (For the groom) to forgo (his half) is closer to piety. But do not (forgo or) forget to show courtesy (and kindness) to one another. Indeed, Allah (vigilantly) watches everything you do"
