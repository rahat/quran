    "text": "Of course, the (hills of) ´safa´ and ´Marwa´ are among the symbols of Allah. Anyone who goes on Hajj (the pilgrimage), or the ´umrah´ (the visit), to the house (of Allah) may perform the ritual of running to and fro between these hills. There is no sin in that. It is better to perform this (ritual) on purpose. Allah knows the grateful ones; He is the all-Knowing"
