    "text": "Mankind was all a single community (with a single faith). Then, (they differed and so) Allah raised prophets (among them) as bearers of good news, and as warners. He also revealed to them the scripture containing the truth, so it may settle matters about which people had differed among themselves. They did not (splinter and) differ until after the manifest proofs had already come to them; (and they differed) because of mutual hatred (and jealousy). Then, by His leave, Allah guided the believers towards the truth concerning all matters in which they had differed. Allah guides to the straight path whomever He wants"
