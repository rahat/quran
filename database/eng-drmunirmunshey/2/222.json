    "text": "They ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is a vulnerable (and unclean) condition. So, keep away from (having sexual intercourse with) your women during menstruation. Do not approach them till they are (off their period and) clean. Once they have (bathed and) cleansed themselves, you can then come to them as Allah has ordained you to do. Indeed Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly, and He loves those who maintain a clean state (of being)"
