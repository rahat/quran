    "text": "Can anyone be more unjust (and evil) than the one who forbids people from mentioning His name in AllahÂ´s Houses of worship, and does his utmost to hurt them? In fact, such (unjust) ones are themselves not worthy of being let into the Holy House except in fear. Disgrace is their lot in this world, and in the life-to-come they shall have the severest (most awful) punishment"
