    "text": "Of course, Allah is not ashamed to quote and narrate the parable of a gnat, or anything smaller. Those who believe know that it certainly is the truth from their Lord. But those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by this parable?\" Thereby, He causes many to stray, and leads many others to the right path! By that, He misleads only the sinful rebellious ones"
