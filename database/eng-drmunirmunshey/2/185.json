    "text": "Ramadhan is the month during which the QurÂ´an was revealed. It is (not only) the guidance for mankind, (but is also) the self-evident proof of (the truth of) that guidance, and (it is) the criterion (of the right and the wrong conduct). Whoever among you lives to see that month, must observe fasts (during that month). Whoever among you is sick or on a journey, (must fast) the same number of other days. Allah wants to make matters easy for you; He does not want to impose hardships on you. So complete the period (of fasting). Glorify Allah (and thank Him) for the guidance He has granted. Perhaps, you would be grateful"
