    "text": "Divorce can only be (revoked) twice. After that, the divorced woman must be retained with honor (and love) or allowed to leave with (kindness and) grace. It is not permissible for you to take back anything you had given to her, except when (divorce occurs because) the two of them fear that they might not be able to abide by the bounds of Allah. If you fear that the two of you may not be able to stay within the bounds of Allah, then there is no sin upon either of you if she gives back something to gain her freedom. These are the bounds of Allah. Do not transgress them. Those who overstep the bounds of Allah are indeed the evildoers"
