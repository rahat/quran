    "text": "Yet, it is you who killed one another. You drove one of your groups out of their homes. With sin and transgression aforethought, you assisted their enemies against them. You demanded ransom when some of your own people were brought as captives before you. In fact, you were forbidden to expel them from their homes (in the first place). Do you believe in just some parts of the scriptures, and reject the rest? What is the fair recompense for the one among you who does that? (What else) except disgrace in the life of this world? On the day of resurrection, they are destined to be consigned to the (severest) most grievous punishment. Allah is not unaware of anything you do"
