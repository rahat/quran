    "text": "Are you not aware of the (undue demands of the) leaders of the Israelites after Musa? They said to their prophet, \"Assign (and enthrone) someone as our king, so we may fight for the cause of Allah.\" (The Prophet) said, \"Might it happen that you would (hesitate and) fail to fight, if fighting was actually prescribed for you?\" They replied, \"Is anything wrong with us? Why would we not fight for the cause of Allah? We, and our children, have been driven out of our homes!\" Yet, except a few, they all turned away when fighting was actually ordained for them. Allah is very well aware of the evil doers"
