    "text": "The month of Hajj (is specified and fixed, and) is well known. Whoever decides to perform Hajj (must visit the sacred House) during that month (and) must abstain from sexual relations. He must abstain from wickedness, and wrangling of all sorts. Allah knows whatever good you do. For your journey, pack and carry along with you the provisions and supplies. (However), the best provision to bring along is piety. Fear Me, oh men of reason (and intellect)"
