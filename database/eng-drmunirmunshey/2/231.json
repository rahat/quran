    "text": "After you divorce your wife and she completes the (prescribed) term, then either hold her back (in wedlock) amicably or let her leave honorably. Do not hold her in order to hurt (or harass) her, else you would transgress (the bounds of Allah). Whoever does that commits an outrage upon himself. Do not take the laws of Allah as a jest (or treat them frivolously). Remember the favors of Allah upon you, and the scriptures and the wisdom He has revealed to you. It instructs you (towards the right path). So, be (devoted and) dutiful towards Allah and be sure that indeed Allah knows every single thing"
