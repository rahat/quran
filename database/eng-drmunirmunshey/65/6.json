If they happen to be carrying (your) child, then spend and bear their expenses till they carry their pregnancies to term. If they are nursing (your child), then compensate them in a fair and equitable manner. Settle the issue (of compensation) between you and your (former) wives amicably. Should the matter (of compensation) be difficult (and hard to resolve), then any other woman may nurse the child"
