    "text": "We have assigned the camels to be the ceremonial sacrificial animals for you. That is a blessing for you. Invoke AllahÂ´s name upon them at the time of sacrifice. Then when their carcasses come to rest, eat their meat and offer it to the needy _ those who ask for it, as well as those who are reticent. This is how much We have tamed them for your sake! Perhaps you will feel grateful"
