    "text": "They have been driven out of their homes for no other reason except that they say, \"Allah is our Lord!\" Allah causes the fall of different people _ each by another. Otherwise, many places of worship _ like the monasteries, the temples, the churches and the mosques where AllahÂ´s name is chanted a lot _ would be demolished. Allah will most definitely help those who help His cause. Of course, Allah is the Strongest and the most Powerful"
