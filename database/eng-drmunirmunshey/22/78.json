    "text": "And struggle all out for Allah. For, this struggle merits an all out effort. He has chosen you and has placed no hardship in your religion, the creed of your father, Ibraheem. Not only in this (Qur´an), but in the past, too, He had named you Muslims. (He chose you) so the messengers may witness your deeds (and testify), and you may witness the deeds of the rest of the people (and testify). So establish the ´salat´ and pay the ´zakat´ and hold on to your link with Allah. He is your Master! What an excellent Master! And what an excellent Ally"
