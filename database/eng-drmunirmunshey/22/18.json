    "text": "Do you not observe that everyone (and everything) in the heavens and on the earth falls prostrate before Allah: the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the beasts, and a lot of people, too! Punishment has become warranted for many others (who do not prostrate). There is no honor for the one whom Allah humiliates. Undoubtedly, Allah does what He wills"
