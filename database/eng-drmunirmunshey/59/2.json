    "text": "It is He Who drove the disbelievers, the people of the book, from their homes at the very start of assembly (the siege against them). You never thought they would depart (without resistance). And they thought their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah came upon them from where they least expected. He cast terror in their hearts, so they ruined their homes with their own hands, and the hands of the believers. So learn the lesson, Oh you, endowed with sights"
