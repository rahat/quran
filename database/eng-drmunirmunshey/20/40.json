    "text": "(Remember) when your sister walked (along the box) and said to those who found the child, \"Shall I guide you to a wet nurse for him?\" Thus We sent you back to your mother, to soothe her and to keep her from grieving. Then you killed a man. We rescued you from that distress. We had you go through a terrible ordeal. You lived with the people of Madyan a number of years. And now, you have arrived here at just the right (preordained) time"
