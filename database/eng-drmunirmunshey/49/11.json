    "text": "Oh you who believe! Let not one ethnic group ridicule another ethnic group. It may just be that those being mocked are actually better. Similarly, do not let (some) women deride other women, because the women being laughed at, may happen to be better. Do not defame or slander each other. Do not yell (racial, ethnic or other) slurs and epithets at each other. After entering faith, it is not right to insult others with disdainful names. Those who fail to repent and desist are really the evildoers"
