    "text": "If peace breaks down between two groups of believers, and they begin to fight, (call a truce and) bring them to terms. If one of the groups is the transgressor, (all of you should) fight the group that is unjust, until it complies and returns to the commands of Allah. Once that happens, make peace between the groups fairly and equitably. Indeed Allah loves those who are just"
