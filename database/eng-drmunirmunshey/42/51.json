    "text": "It is not seemly; Allah does not talk to a mortal (directly). He talks to a human (indirectly) from behind a screen, or sparks an inspiration in his mind. Or, He may send (an angel as) a messenger. With His permission, (the angel) conveys what Allah wills. Indeed, He is the most Eminent and the Wisest"
