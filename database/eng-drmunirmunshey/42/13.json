    "text": "He enacted rules (and rites) for your religion which are the same (rules) as He decreed for (the messenger) Nooh. What We have revealed to you are the same commandments as We gave to (the messengers) Ibraheem, Musa and Jesus: (namely) to establish the faith and not (disunite and) splinter into sects. (Oh Muhammad, SAW), what you are calling them towards _ (the worship of the One true god, Allah) _ is too burdensome to bear for those accepting other gods beside Him. Allah selects whom He wants, and guides along His path the one who turns to Him (in repentance)"
