Do not, therefore, take from them allies until they emigrate in the way of Allah, but if they turn their backs (on emigration), seize them and slay them wherever you come upon them. Take none of them for your ally or helper, This is the verdict on those hypocritical confessors of faith who belong to a belligerent, non-Muslim nation and actually participate in acts of hostility against the Islamic state"

If they leave you alone and do not fight against you and offer you peace,, then Allah does not permit you to harm them"

It is against these that We have granted you a clear sanction"
