And do not force your slave-girls into prostitution for your own worldly gains when they themselves want to keep chaste; and if anyone forces them into it, after such a compulsion Allah will be forgiving and merciful for them"

He cites parables to make the Message clear to the people; He has perfect knowledge of everything"
