The adversaries are told that they can observe God's signs in the phenomena of the universe, just as Abraham could. The difference is that they see nothing, as if they were blind, whereas Abraham saw with open eyes.

Yet the same signs were observed by the perceptive Abraham, and the physical phenomena helped him arrive at the Truth"
