    "text": "And they ask \"What ought we to spend (in the way of Allah)\"? Say \"Spend whatever you can spare.\" Thus Allah makes His commands clear to you so that you may think about the good of both this world and the Hereafter. They ask you about the right way of dealing with orphans. Say \"The right way is that which is for their good.\" Then there is no harm if you live a common life with them for they are after all your own brethren. Allah knows well the one who means harm and also the one who means good. If Allah had willed He would have been hard upon you in this matter for He is All-Powerful but He is at the same time AlI-Wise"
