    "text": "Have you also reflected upon the matter concerning the chiefs of the Israelites after (the death of) Moses? They said to their Prophet, \"Appoint a king for us so that we may fight in the way of Allah.\" The Prophet asked them, \"Might it be that you will not fight, if fighting is prescribed for you?\" They replied, \"How can it be that we would refuse to fight in the way of Allah when we have been turned out of our homes and separated from our children?\" But (in spite of this assurance) when they were enjoined to fight, they all, except a few of them, turned their backs. And Allah knows each and everyone of these transgressors"
