    "text": "Or take the case of the one who passed by a township that had fallen down upon its roofs. He exclaimed, \"How shall Allah bring back to life this township that has become dead?\" At this Allah caused him to die and he lay dead for a hundred years. Then Allah brought him back to life and asked him, \"How long have you lain here?\" He answered. \"I might have lain here for a day or a few hours.\" Allah said, \"Nay, you have been lying here in this state for a hundred years: now, just have a look at your food and your drink; they have not become spoiled in the least. Then have a look at your ass, (and see that his very bones have become rotten) and We have done this in order to make you a Sign for the people. Look, how We raise up the skeleton and set the bones (of the ass) and cover them with flesh and (put breath of life into them).\" And when the Reality became manifest to him, he said, \"I know that Allah has power over everything"
