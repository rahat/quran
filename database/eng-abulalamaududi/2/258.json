    "text": "Have you not considered the case of the person who had an argument with Abraham as to `Whom Abraham acknowledged as his Lord?' The dispute arose because Allah had given him the kingship, (which had made him arrogant). When Abraham said, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death,\" he answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" Then Abraham said, \"Well, Allah brings the sun from the east: just bring it from the west.\" At this the disbeliever was confounded: (yet he did not believe), for Allah does not show guidance to unjust people"
