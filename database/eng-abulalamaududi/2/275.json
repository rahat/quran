    "text": "But those who devour interest become like the one whom Satan has bewitched and maddened by his touch. They have been condemned to this condition because they say, \"Trade is just like interest\", whereas Allah has made trade lawful and interest unlawful. Henceforth, if one abstains from taking interest after receiving this admonition from his Lord, no legal action will be taken against him regarding the interest he had devoured before; his case shall ultimately go to Allah. But if one repeats the same crime after this,. he shall go to Hell, where he shall abide for ever"
