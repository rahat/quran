Afterwards when Saul, and those who had believed with him, crossed the river and advanced forward, the former said to Saul, \"We have no power left this day to fight against Goliath and his hosts.\" But those who believed that one Day they shall meet Allah, declared, \"lt has often been that a small host has, by Allah's grace, overcome a big host: for Allah is with those who show fortitude"

There were others whom He raised high in rank in other ways. Likewise We gave clear signs to Jesus, son of Mary, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah so willed the people who had seen clear signs would not have fought against one another after the Prophets. But (it was not Allah's will to prevent people forcibly from differences: so) they disagreed; then some of them accepted the Truth and others rejected it. If Allah had so willed they would have never fought against one another, but Allah does whatever He pleases (to fulfil His designs)"
