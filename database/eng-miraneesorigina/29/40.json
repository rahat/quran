So among them was he on whom We sent a sand-storm (or a rain of hot volcanic debris), and among them was he whom the loud cry afflicted, and among them was he whom We caused to sink into the earth, and among them was he whom We drowned and it was not Allah Who was unjust to them but they used to be unjust to themselves"
