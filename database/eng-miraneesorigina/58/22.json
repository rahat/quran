    "text": "You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the period hereafter, loving those who resist Allah and His messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their relatives (and friends). Those are the persons in whose hearts He has written down belief and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him. And He will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein, Allah pleased with them and they pleased with Him. Those are (the members of) the team of Allah. Beware ! (the members of) the team of Allah, they are the successful ones"
