    "text": "O prophet! when you divorce women then divorce them for their prescribed term and calculate the prescribed term and fear Allah your Fosterer. Do not drive them out from their houses nor should they themselves go out, unless they commit an open indecency. And those are the limits of Allah and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, he has indeed been unjust to his own soul, you do not know, perhaps Allah may bring about an event (of reunion) after that"
