And We communicated to Musa, when his people asked him for water, to strike the rock with his staff; thus twelve springs gushed out from it, (and) all people came to know their drinking place. And We made the clouds to give shade over them and sent down on them manna and quails (saying), \"Eat of the good things which We have provided for you.\" And they did not do injustice to Us but they were unjust to their own souls"
