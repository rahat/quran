    "text": "And a bearer of burden will not bear the burden of another (person) and if one heavy with burden calls (someone) for carrying it, none will carry anything of it even though he be a relative. You can warn only those who fear their Fosterer unseen and establish worship (salat). And whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the benefit of) his own soul and towards Allah is the destination"
