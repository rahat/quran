    "text": "O you who believe! be helpers of Allah: as Isa, the son of Maryam, had said to the disciples, “Who are my helpers in (the cause of) Allah?” The disciples said, “We are the helpers of Allah.” So a party of the children of Israel believed and a party did not believe. Then We strengthened those who believed, against their enemy, so they became victorious"
