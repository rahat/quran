    "text": "Know that the life of this world is nothing but sport and pastime and pomp and boasting among yourselves and competition for increase in wealth and children, it is like rain, the growth of vegetation through which pleases the farmer, then it dries up and you see it become yellow, then it becomes broken pieces. And in the hereafter there is severe punishment and protective forgiveness and pleasure from Allah. And the life of this world is nothing but a deceptive provision"
