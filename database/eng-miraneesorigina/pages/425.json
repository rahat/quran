And when you ask the (ladies) for anything, then ask them from behind a curtain, that is cleaner for your hearts and their hearts. And it does not befit you to annoy the messenger of Allah, nor is it (permissible to you) that you should ever marry his wives after him, that is certainly a great (sin) in the sight of Allah"
