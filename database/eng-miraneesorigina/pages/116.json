For everyone of you We have appointed a law and a way (to follow the law). And had Allah willed He would have made you a single community, but (He did not do so) to test you through that which He has given you, so compete in good deeds. Towards Allah is your return, of all (of you), then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ"
