    "text": "Allah is the light of the skies and the earth. The likeness of His light is like an enclosure with one opening in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as if it were a brilliant shining planet,(the lamp) is lit from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil is almost inflammable although fire has not (even) touched it, light upon light, Allah guides to His light whom He wills and Allah sets forth similitudeâ€™s for mankind and Allah is the Knower of everything"
