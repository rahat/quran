    "text": "And let those who do not find the means to marry, restrain (themselves by keeping chaste), till Allah enriches them out of His grace. And from among those whom your right hands possess (slaves), those who seek a written (declaration from you for freeing themselves by paying you some money), then write it for them if you know any good in them and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution when they intend to be chaste, in order to seek the apparent good of the life of this world, and whoever compels them, then after their being compelled, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
