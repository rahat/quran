    "text": "O you who believe! let those whom your right hands possess (slaves/servants) and those among you who have not reached the age of puberty seek your permission three times: Before the worship (salat) of dawn, and at the time when you put off your clothes due to afternoon heat, and after the worship (salat) of night. (These are the) three times of privacy for you. There is no sin on you or on them beyond (these) times if they move about you, some (attending) on others. Thus Allah makes clear to you the signs and Allah is Knowing, Wise"
