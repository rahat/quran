    "text": "Allah has sent down the best statements (in the form of) a book, (these statements are) similar (to each other and not contradictory and are) repeated. The skins of those who fear their Fosterer tremble (in response to the effect produced) by it, then their skins and their hearts soften towards the remembrance of Allah. That is guidance of Allah, He guides through it whom He wills, and whom Allah leaves to stray then there is no guide for him"
