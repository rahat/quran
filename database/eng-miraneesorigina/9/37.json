    "text": "Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an increase in infidelity through which are misled those who do not believe; they make it lawful one year and unlawful (another) year, that they may make up the number of months which Allah has made unlawful (for fighting). Thus they make lawful what Allah has made unlawful. The evil of their deeds is made fair seeming to them and Allah does not guide a people who are infidels"
