    "text": "Your Fosterer certainly knows that you stand (for worship, salat) nearly two thirds of the night and (sometimes) half of it or one third of it along with a party of those with you, and Allah measures out the night and the day, He knows that you are not able to keep count of the (length of night), so He has turned to you (mercifully). Therefore recite as much of the Quran as may be easy for you. He knows that there will be (some who are) sick among you and others traveling in the earth seeking from Allahâ€™s grace and (still) others fighting in the way of Allah. So recite as much of the (Quran) as may be easy (for you) and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and loan to Allah a good loan. And whatever of good you send in advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, (and) it will be better and greater in reward (compared to your good deeds). And seek protective forgiveness from Allah, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
