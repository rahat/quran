    "text": "Those of the desert Arabs who were left behind will say to you, “Our wealth and our people kept us occupied, so seek protective forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say, “Then who can control anything for you against Allah, if He intends to harm you or intends to benefit you? No, Allah is informed of that which you do.”"
