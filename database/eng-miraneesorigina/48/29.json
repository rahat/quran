    "text": "Muhammed is the messenger of Allah, and those with him are strong against the infidels and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing down, prostrating, seeking grace from Allah and (His) pleasure, their marks due to the effect of, prostrations are there in their faces. That is their likeness (mentioned) in the Torah and their likeness mentioned in the Injeel. (They are) like vegetation which (first) puts forth its sprout then it becomes firm then it becomes thick, then it stands balanced on its stem, pleasing the sowers, that He may make the infidels angry through them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous works, protective forgiveness and a great reward"
