    "text": "O owners of the book ! do not commit excesses in your religion, and do not say about Allah (anything) other than the truth. The Messiah, Isa the son of Maryam, was only a messenger of Allah and His word which He communicated to Maryam and a spirit from Him, so believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, \"Three,\" it will be better for you (if) you stop (saying it). Allah is only One God (and not one of the three as Christians claim). It is far from His Glory that He should have a son for Himself. Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee"
