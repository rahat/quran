And whoever kills a believer (even) by mistake, he should set free a believing slave and pay the blood money to the people (of the slain), except that (the people of the slain do not take the money and) leave it as charity. And if the slain was from a people who are at enemity with you but he was a believer then he (the murderer) should set free a believing slave; the slain was from a people between whom and you is a treaty, then the blood-money should be paid to his (slain's) people and (in addition, the murderer) should set free a believing slave, and one who cannot find (the means) should in that case, fast for two successive months. A penance from Allah and Allah is Knowing, Wise. people (of the slain), except that (the people of the slain do not take the money and) leave it as charity.
