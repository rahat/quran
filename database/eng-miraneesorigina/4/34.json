    "text": "Men are established over women because of that in which Allah has been (more) gracious to some (men), compared to others (women), and because of that which the (men) spend from their wealth; therefore the righteous women are obedient, guardians of the unseen (their chastity in all respects), which Allah (orders that it should be) guarded. And as for those (women) from whom you fear confrontation, admonish them and leave them alone in their sleeping places and strike them (by word or action) then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them, Allah is certainly High, Great"
