    "text": "O you who believe ! retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of murder: the free for the free, and the slave for the slave and the female for the female. And for him who is pardoned somewhat by his (injured) brother, there should be prosecution according to recognised (good procedure) and payment to him in good manner. This is a relaxation from your Fosterer and (His) mercy. Then whoever exceeds the limits after that, then for him there is a painful punishment"
