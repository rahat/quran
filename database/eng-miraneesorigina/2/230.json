    "text": "So if he divorces her (for the third time), then she is not lawful for him thereafter until she marries another husband, then if he (the second husband also) divorces her then there is no sin upon them both (first husband and wife) if they return to each other (in wedlock) if they think that they can keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. And those are the limits (imposed by) Allah which He makes clear for a people who have knowledge"
