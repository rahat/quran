    "text": "And there is no sin on you in speaking indirectly to ask (such) women in marriage or in keeping such intention to yourselves. Allah knows that you will mention (it to) them, but do not promise to them in secret except that you speak words recognised (to be good) and do not resolve on the marriage tie, till the prescribed term reaches its end, and know that Allah knows that which is in your souls, so be cautious of Him and know that Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Clement (Kind)"
