    "text": "And the mothers shall suckle their children for two complete years, for him who desires to complete the suckling. And the duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers in recognized (good manner), is upon the father of the child. No one is to be burdened but to the extent of his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child nor a father on account of his child. And (the responsibility) on the heir, is similar to that (which was on the father). But if both desire weaning * by mutual agreement and consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you wish to engage a wet-nurse for your children there is no sin on you, when you pay what is due from you according to the recognised (good procedure), and fear Allah and know that Allah is the Seer of whatever you do. * Stopping mother's milk. -nurse for your children there is no sin on you, when you pay what is due from you according to the recognised (good procedure), and fear Allah and know that Allah is the Seer of whatever you do. * Stopping mother's milk"
