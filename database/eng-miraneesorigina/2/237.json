    "text": "And if you divorce women before you have touched them but you have settled for them a settlement (dowry), then (you have to pay) half of that which you have settled (as dowry), except that the (women) forgo, or he in whose hand is the marriage tie, forgoes it, and that you forgo is nearer to guarding (against evil), and you do not forget (exchange of) gifts among yourselves, Allah is certainly the Seer of that which you do"
