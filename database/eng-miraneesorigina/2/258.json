    "text": "Did you not consider him who argued with Ibrahim about his Fosterer because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said, \"My Fosterer is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause to die.\" Ibrahim said, \"Then certainly Allah causes the sun to rise from the east, so you cause it to rise from the west.\" Thus, he who did not believe was confused. And Allah does not guide a people who are unjust"
