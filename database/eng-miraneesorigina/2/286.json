Our Fosterer ! do not catch us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Fosterer ! and do not lay on us a burden like the one which was laid by You on those before us. Our Fosterer ! and do not lay on us (a burden for ) which we do not have the strength to bear, and pardon us, and protectively forgive us, and have mercy on us, You are our Guardian so help us against the people who are infidels"
