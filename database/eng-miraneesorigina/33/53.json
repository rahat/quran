    "text": "O you who believe! do not enter the houses of the prophet unless permission is given to you, do not wait for a meal (inside the house) till the time it is cooked, but enter when you are invited and when you have (finished) taking the meal then disperse and do not seek to get involved in conversation, that certainly annoys the prophet but he feels shy of you (to ask you to go) while Allah does not feel shy of the truth. And when you ask the (ladies) for anything, then ask them from behind a curtain, that is cleaner for your hearts and their hearts. And it does not befit you to annoy the messenger of Allah, nor is it (permissible to you) that you should ever marry his wives after him, that is certainly a great (sin) in the sight of Allah"
