    "text": "And when you said to him (Zaid) whom Allah had favored and whom you (too) had favored, “Retain your wife with you and fear Allah.” And you kept secret in your soul that which Allah was to expose and you did fear human beings while Allah has the greater right that you should fear Him. Then, when Zaid fulfilled the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) her, We joined her to you in marriage, so that there should be no blame on the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they fulfill the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) them, and the order of Allah was to be executed"
