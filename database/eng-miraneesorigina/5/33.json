    "text": "The only reward of those who wage a war against Allah and His messenger and strive in the earth (to cause) corruption ( in it), is that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and feet should be cut off from opposite sides or they should be sent on exile from the land. That is their disgrace in the world, and in the hereafter there is a great punishment for them"
