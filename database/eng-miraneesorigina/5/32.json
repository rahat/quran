    "text": "For that reason, We prescribed for the children of Israel that whoever kills anyone without (it being a killing of the murderer of) someone, or due to corruption in the earth, then it will be as if he killed all human beings; and whoever saves a life then it will be as if he saved the lives of all human beings. And Our messengers had come to them with clear proofs, then even after that many of them are committers of excesses in the earth"
