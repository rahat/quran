    "text": "O messenger ! do not let those persons grieve you, who rush towards infidelity from among those who say with their mouths, \"We believe,\" but their hearts do not believe and from those who are Jews, listeners of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other people who have not come to you, they alter the words after (knowing) their proper places, saying, \"If you are given this then take it and if you are not given this then be cautious.\" And for him, whose trial Allah intends, you will never have any power for him against Allah, those are the persons for whom Allah does not intend to clean their hearts. For them there is disgrace in the world and there is a great punishment for them in the hereafter"
