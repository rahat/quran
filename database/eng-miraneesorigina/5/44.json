    "text": "We had sent down the Torah, in it was guidance and light, the prophets who had submitted, had based their judgment on it for (judging) those who were Jews, (and so did) the rabbis and the priests, because they were required to guard the book (law) of Allah and they were witnesses over it. So do not fear human beings but fear Me and do not sell My signs for a small price, and whoever does not base his judgment on that which Allah has sent down (as Divine communication), then those are the infidels"
