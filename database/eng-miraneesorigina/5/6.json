    "text": "O you who believe ! when you rise up for worship (salat), then wash your faces and your hands upto the elbows and wipe your heads and (wash) your feet upto the ankles and if you have not taken a bath after sexual intercourse (or passing out of semen during sleep etc.) then clean (your whole body by taking bath). And if you are on a journey or one of you comes from the toilet or you have touched women, then, (under the above circumstances) if you do not find water, or if you are sick, then take clean dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Allah does not intend to put any difficulty on you, but He intends to clean you that He may complete His favour on you so that you may be grateful"
