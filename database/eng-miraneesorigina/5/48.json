    "text": "And We have sent down to you the book (Quran) containing the truth, a confirmation of what was before it of the book (Divine Law) and a guardian over it (earlier Divine Law), so judge between them by that which Allah has sent down and do not follow their desires (turning away) from the truth which has come to you. For everyone of you We have appointed a law and a way (to follow the law). And had Allah willed He would have made you a single community, but (He did not do so) to test you through that which He has given you, so compete in good deeds. Towards Allah is your return, of all (of you), then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ"
