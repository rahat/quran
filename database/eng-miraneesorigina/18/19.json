A speaker from among them said, “How long have you stayed (here)?” They said, “We stayed (here) a day or a part of a day.” (Others) said, “Your Fosterer knows best about how long you stayed (here). Now send one of you to the city with this silver coin of yours and let him see what food is pure, then let him come to you with (some) provision from it, and let him be courteous and let no one know about you"
