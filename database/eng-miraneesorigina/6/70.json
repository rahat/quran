    "text": "And leave alone those who take their religion as sport and pastime and those whom the life of this world has deceived, but remind through it lest a soul be destroyed due to what it earned. There will be no guardian for it besides Allah and there will be no mediator and if it (tries to) compensate with every compensation it will not be accepted from it. Those are the persons who will be destroyed due to what they earned, there will be a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for them because they did not believe"
