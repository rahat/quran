    "text": "So, (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He should guide him, He opens his bosom for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should leave him straying, He makes his bosom close and narrow as if he were ascending in the sky (when one gets suffocated due to lack of oxygen). Thus Allah lays uncleanliness on those who do not believe"
