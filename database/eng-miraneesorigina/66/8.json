    "text": "O you who believe ! turn towards Allah with sincere repentance, perhaps your Fosterer will remove from you (the effect of) your evil deeds and make you enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not disgrace the prophet and those who believed with him, their light will be running before them and on their right hands, they will say, “Our Fosterer ! perfect our light for us and protectively forgive us, You certainly have power over everything.”"
