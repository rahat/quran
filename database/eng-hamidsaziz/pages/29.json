Allah knows that you did defraud yourselves, wherefore He has turned towards you and forgiven you; so now go in unto them and crave what Allah has prescribed (or ordained) for you, and eat and drink until a white thread can be distinguished by you from a black one at the dawn. Then fulfil the fast until the night, and go not in unto them while you are at your devotions in the mosques. These are the bounds that Allah has set, so draw not near thereto. Thus does Allah make manifest His signs to men, that per chance (or possibly) they may learn restraint"
