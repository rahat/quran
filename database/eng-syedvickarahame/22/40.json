    "text": "Those who have been expelled from their homes (unjustly) in defiance of right— (For no reason) except that they say, \"Our Lord is Allah.\" Did Allah not stop one set of people by means of another, for sure, there have been destroyed, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where the Name of Allah is praised most often. Allah will surely help those who support (His) cause— Because truly, Allah is Full of Strength (Qhavi), exalted in Might (Aziz)"
