If you have doubt about being raised (for Judgment, remember that) We created you from dust, then out of semen (see verse 36.77), then out of a watery clot then out of a part of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may make you be aware of (Our Power); And We make whom We wish to stay in the wombs for a fixed time, then We bring you out as (baby) infants, then (make you grow up so) that you may reach your age of full strength; And some of you are picked to die young, and some are picked for the weak old age, so that he does not know much after knowing (a lot), and (also), you see the earth that is empty and lifeless but when We pour rain upon it, it is moved (to life), and it swells, and it puts out every type of beautiful growth (in pairs)"
