He has chosen you, and has made no hardships for you in (your) religion; It is the religion of your father Ibrahim (Abraham). It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this (Revelation, the Quran); So that the Messenger (Muhammad) may be a witness for you, and you be a witness for mankind! So perform regular Prayer, give regular Charity, and hold strongly to Allah! He is your Protector (Maula)— Best to protect (An-Na’um), Best to help (An-Naseer)"
