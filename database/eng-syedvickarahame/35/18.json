    "text": "And no bearer of burdens shall bear another (personâ€™s) burden. And if one (person) carrying a heavy burden should call another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted (by the other) even though he be near of kin (closely related). (O Prophet!) you can only warn those who fear their Lord, Unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself (from all kinds of sin) does it to benefit his own soul; And the Return (of all) is to Allah"
