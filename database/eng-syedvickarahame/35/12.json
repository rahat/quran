    "text": "And the two (seas) kinds of water are not alike (and the same)â€” One is tasteful, sweet and pleasant to drink, and the other, (tastes of) salt and is bitter. Yet from (both of) them, you eat fresh and tender flesh (fish and foods from the seas); From each (group of water), and you take out ornaments (pearls) to wear; And in there you see the ships that go through the waves, for you to search from the (riches and) bounty of Allah that you may be thankful"
