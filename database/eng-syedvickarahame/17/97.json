    "text": "And he whom Allah guides, he is on true guidance; And he whom He leaves astrayâ€” For those you will find no protector besides Him. And on the Day of Judgment, We shall bring them together lying on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf: Their home will be Hell: Every time it reduces, We shall increase for them the intensity of the Fire"
