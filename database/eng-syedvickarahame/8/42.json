Even if you had made a mutual time to meet (for war), you would certainly have failed at that time: But (again you met) for Allah to complete an act already decided; So that those who died would die after a clear Sign (of Allah), and those who lived would live after a clear Sign (of Allah). And surely Allah is All Seeing (Samiâ€™) and All Knowing (Aleem, all things)"
