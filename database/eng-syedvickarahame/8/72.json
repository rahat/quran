    "text": "Verily, those who believed, and who left their homes (in the time of Hijrah), and who fought for the Faith with their property and their persons, in the Cause of Allah, and those who gave (them) shelter and helpâ€” These are (all) friends and protectors, of one another. And as to those who believed but did not leave their homes (or emigrate in Hijrah), you have no duty to protect them, until they do emigrate (and come into your protection); But if they ask for your help in religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance (agreement or friendship). And (remember) Allah sees all that you do"
