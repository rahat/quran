    "text": "They are the ones who disbelieved the Message and stopped you from the Sacred Mosque (at Makkah) and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. If there were no believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you were pushing aside and killed, and on whose account a crime would have resulted from you without (your) knowledge, (Allah would have allowed you to force your way, but He withheld your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they were identified, We, certainly would have punished the unbelievers among them with a painful punishment"
