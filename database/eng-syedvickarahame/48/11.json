    "text": "The desert Arabs (the Bedouins) who fell behind (to avoid fighting) will say to you: \"We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds, and our families: Do you then ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say (to them): \"Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah, if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? No! Allah is always All Aware (Khabir) with all that you do"
