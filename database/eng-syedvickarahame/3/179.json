    "text": "Allah will not leave the believers in the state that which you are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good. Nor will Allah disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But Allah chooses as His messengers (for the purpose of revealing) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah and His messengers: And if you believe and be pious to Allah, you have a great reward (without measure)"
