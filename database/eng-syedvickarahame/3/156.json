Do not be like the Unbelievers, and who say of their brothers, when they are traveling through the earth or engaged in fighting: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or have been killed.\" (This is) because Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives Life and Death, and Allah is All Seeing (Baseer) all that you do"
