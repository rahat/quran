    "text": "And Allah did indeed fulfill His promise to you, when you, with His permission were about to destroy your enemyâ€” Until you hesitated and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the things won over in the war) which you love. Among you are some who desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter. He diverted you from your enemies in order to test you. Yet surely, He forgave you: And Allah is full of Grace to those who believe"
