But those in whose hearts is evil follow the part within it that is abstract seeking disharmony, in searching for hidden meanings; But no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah: And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in the Book: The whole of it is from our Lord:\" And none will grasp the Message except men of understanding"
