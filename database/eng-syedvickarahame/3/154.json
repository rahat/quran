    "text": "Then after the distress (and unhappiness), He sent down calm on a group of you overcome with sleep, while another group became anxious by their own feelings, moved by wrong suspicions of Allah— Suspicions due to ignorance. They said: \"What affair is this of ours?\" You say (to them): \"Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah’s.\" They hide in their minds what they dare not say to you. They say (to themselves): \"If we had anything to do with this affair, none of us should have been in the slaughter here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, for those whom death had to come, would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death;\" But (all of this was) because Allah might test what is in your chests; And purify what is in your hearts. And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) the secrets of your breasts (hearts)"
