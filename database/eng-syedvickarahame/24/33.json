And if any of your slaves ask for a note (of promise) in writing (to enable them to earn their freedom), give them such a note (of promise); If you know any good (ones) from them; And give them something from yourselves out of the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon you. And do not force your maids to prostitution when they like purity (of their moral conduct), so that you may make a gain in things of this life. But if anyone forces (or has forced) them (the maids), still, after such compulsion (or circumstances), Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem) (to the maids because of the force or compulsion)"
