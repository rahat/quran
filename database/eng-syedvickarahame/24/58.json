    "text": "O you who believe! Let those whom your right hands possess, (servants and servant-girls) and the (children) among you who have not come of age (to puberty) ask your permission (before they come in your presence), on three occasions: Before the morning prayer; And the time you take off your clothes for the mid-day (afternoon) heat; And after the late-night prayer: (These) are your (three) times for privacy: At times other than these, it is not wrong for you or for them to move about taking care of each other. Thus Allah makes the Signs clear to you: And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) and All Wise (Hakeem)"
