Do not follow Satan's footsteps: If any will follow the footsteps of Satan's, verily, he will command what is shameful and wrong: And if it was not because of Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, not (even) one of you would ever have been pure: But Allah does purify whomsoever He pleases: And Allah is All Hearing (Sami’), All Knowing (Aleem)"
