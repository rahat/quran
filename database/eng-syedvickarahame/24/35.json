    "text": "Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as though there is a Niche (opening) and within it is a Lamp: The Lamp is enclosed in glass: The glass as if it was (itself) a bright star: Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the East nor of the West, whose Oil is almost (by itself) bright, even though fire never touched it: Light upon Light! Allah guides whomever He wills to His Light: And Allah sets forth parables for mankind: And Allah knows all things"
