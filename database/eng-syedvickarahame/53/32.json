    "text": "Those who keep away from great sins and shameful deeds, only (being caught up in) small faults— Surely, your Lord is plentiful in forgiveness. He knows you well when he creates you out of the earth (your chromosomes), and when you are hidden in your mothers’ wombs. Therefore do not justify yourselves: He knows best who it is who keeps away evil"
