    "text": "If you do not help (the Prophet, it is unimportant): Because Allah truly did help him, when the disbelievers drove him out (from Makkah): He (the Prophet) had only one companion (Abu Bakr): The two of them were in the Cave (of Thaur), and he said to his companion, \"Do not fear, because Allah is with us:\" Then Allah sent down His peace (and calm) upon him, and strengthened him with forces that you did not see, and made the word (to take the Prophet’s life) of the disbelievers completely false. But Allah’s Word is glorified to the highest: And Allah is Exalted in Strength (Aziz), All Wise (Hakeem)"
