    "text": "They swear by Allah that they said nothing (evil), but truly they have told lies (and falsehood), and they did this after accepting Islam; And they plotted a scheme (against the Prophet) which they could not carry out: This evil action of theirs was the only return for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) had made them rich! If they repent, that will be the best for them; But if they go back (to their old ways), Allah will punish them with a painful penalty (both) in this life and in the Hereafter: They shall have no one on the earth to protect or help them"
