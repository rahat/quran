    "text": "Verily, in the sight of Allah, the number of months (in a year) is twelve â€” So decided by Him, the day when he created the heavens and the earth; Of them (the twelve months) four are sacred: That is the proper religion. So do not go wrong yourselves about it: And fight the pagans (idolaters and polytheists) all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who are pious (and hold themselves back from evil)"
