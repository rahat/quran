    "text": "Verily, Allah bought from the believers their persons and their goods for (the price) that for them (as a return) shall be the Garden (of Paradise): They fight in His cause, so they kill and are killed: A promise binding upon Him in truth; It is in the Torah [of Musa (Moses)], the Gospel [of Isa (Jesus)], and the Quran (revealed to the Prophet Muhammad). And who is truer to his promise than Allah? Then feel happy in the bargain that you have ended: That is the greatest success"
