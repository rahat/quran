    "text": "Surely, the delaying (of the sacred months) adds to the disbelief: The disbelievers are led to wrong by it: Because they make it a lawful (month) one year, and a forbidden (month) another year, in order to adjust (against) the number of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful.
