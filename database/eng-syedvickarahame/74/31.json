    "text": "And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire: And We have fixed their number (at 19 and it is so written in other Books) confirming it only as a trial for unbelievers— So that the People of the Book (Scripture) may become certain, and the believers may become convinced of their Faith— And that no doubts may be left for the People(s) of the Book (Scripture), and the believers; And that those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) and the unbelievers may say, \"What does Allah mean by this (symbol of 19 angels)?\" Thus does Allah leave to wander those whom He pleases, and guide those whom He pleases. And none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is no other than a warning to mankind"
