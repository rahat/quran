    "text": "Allah has not made for any man, two hearts in his (one) body: Nor, (O people!) has He (Allah) made your wives, whom you declare to be like your mother’s backs (and thus divorce them by the evil practice of Az-Zihar, see 58.2—4), your real mothers: Nor has He made your adopted sons your (real) sons. This is (only) your (manner of) speaking by your mouths. But Allah reveals (to you) the Truth, and He shows the (right) Way"
