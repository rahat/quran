Tell your wives and your daughters, and the believing women, that they should wear their outer clothes over their bodies (when outside): That is most suitable (and appropriate), so that they should be known (as believing women) and not be annoyed (or attacked). And Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
