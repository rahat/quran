    "text": "And (remember) when (O Prophet)! You said to the person (Zaid) who had received the gift from Allah and your favor: \"You keep (the marriage with) your wife and fear Allah. But you did hide in your heart what Allah was about to make it clear: You did fear the people, but it is better that you fear Allah. So, when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, after the necessary (steps of divorce), We joined her in marriage with you: So, that there are no questions for the believers (regarding the) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, after they have dissolved the marriage with the necessary (steps) with them (their ex-wives). And Allahâ€™s (Divine) Order must be completed and fulfilled"
