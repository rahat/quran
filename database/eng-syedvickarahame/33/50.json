Verily, We have made it lawful for you, your wives to whom you have paid their dowers; And those whom your right hand possesses from the prisoners of war whom Allah has given to you; And the daughters of your uncles and aunts, from your fathers side; And the daughters of your uncles and aunts, from your mothers side; Those who moved with you (from Makkah to Medinah); And any believing woman who gives herself to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her; This is only for you (O Prophet), as a privilege and not for (all) the believers; Indeed, We know that for them, We have made lawful their wives and those prisoners whom their right hands possessâ€” So that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
