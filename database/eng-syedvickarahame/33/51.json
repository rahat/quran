    "text": "You can postpone (the turn of) any of them (the women) whom you please, and you may receive any whom you please: And there is no blame on you if you invite one whose (turn) you had put aside. This is better for (their peace of mind), the cooling of eyAes (in the joy of seeing you), to keep off their sorrow, and for their satisfactionâ€” That all of them (are happy) with what you have to give to them: And Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem), Most Forbearing (Haleem)"
