    "text": "O you who believe! When you go abroad in the cause of Allah, find out (everything) carefully, and do not say to anyone who offers you a greeting: \"You are not a believer!\" While wanting the perishable goods of the worldly life. With Allah are plenty of profits and spoils. Even though, you were yourselves (like this) before, till Allah conferred on you His favors: Therefore carefully find out everything (and detail). Verily, Allah is All Aware (Khabeer) of all that you do"
