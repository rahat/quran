    "text": "They ask you for a legal decision: Say: \"Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants (i.e., nobody from later or early generations) as inheritor (of belongings). If it is a man who dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance: If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds (between them): If there are brothers and sisters, (they share) the male having twice the share of the female. Like this does Allah make clear to you (His law), in case you make a mistake and Allah has knowledge of all things"
