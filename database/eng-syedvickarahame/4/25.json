    "text": "If any of you do not have the means with which to wed free believing women, they may wed believing (captive or slave) girls from among those whom your right hand possess: And Allah has full knowledge about your Faith; You being one (individual different) from another. In every case, you are to wed them with the permission of their owners (guardians), and give them their dowries, according to what is reasonable: They should be chaste, not lustful (nor sinful), nor taking (illicit) partners; And when they are taken in wedlock, if they fall into shame, their punishment is half that of free women. This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; But it is better for you that you practice self-control. And Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
