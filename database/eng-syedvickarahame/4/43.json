    "text": "O you who believe! Do not approach prayers (in a murky mind) intoxicated, until you can understand all that you say— Nor in a state of ceremonial impurity except when traveling on the road, until after washing your whole body; And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from offices of nature, or you have been in contact with women, and you find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth and rub with it your faces and hands. Truly, Allah is Ever-Pardoning (’Afuw) and All Forgiving (Ghafoor, again and again)"
