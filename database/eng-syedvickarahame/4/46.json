    "text": "Among the Jews there are some who displace words from (their) right places, and say: \"We hear your word and we disobey;\" And \"Hear what is not heard;\" And (spoken as) Ra'ina; With a twist of their tongues (meaning; ‘the bad one’), and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: \"We hear and we obey;\" And \"Do make us understand (spoken as Unzurna):\" It would have been better for them, and more proper: But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief; And only a few of them will believe"
