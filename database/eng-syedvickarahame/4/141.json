    "text": "(The hypocrites are) the ones who sit and watch about you: If you do gain a victory from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you?\"â€” But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): \"Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?\" But Allah will judge between you on the Day Of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to win) over the believers"
