    "text": "O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witness to Allah, even against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: Allah protects you both (much) better. So follow not the desires (of your hearts), because you may swerve, and if you distort justice, or decline to do justice; Surely, Allah is Well Acquainted (Khabeer) with all that you do"
