    "text": "In that which your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; But if they leave a child, you get a fourth of what they leave; After payment of legacies or debts. In that which you leave, their share is a fourth, if you leave no child; If you leave a child, they get an eighth; After payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither parents nor children, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; But if more than two, they share in a third; After payments of legacies or debts; So that no loss is caused (to anyone). It is thus ordained by Allah; And Allah is Always All Knowing (Aleem), Most Forbearing (Haleem)"
