    "text": "And a believer should never kill a believer; But (if it so happens) by mistake, (compensation is due): If one kills a believer (by mistake) it is necessary that he (the killer) should free a believing slave, and pay compensation (known as blood-money known as Diya) to the dead persons family, unless they remit it freely. If the dead person belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom you had a treaty of mutual understanding, then the compensation (or Diya) should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, he must fast of two months running (without breaks): By way of repentance to Allah: And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem), All Wise (Hakeem)"
