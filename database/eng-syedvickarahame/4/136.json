Believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) that He has sent down to His Messenger (Muhammad) and the Scripture (the Message) that He sent down to those before (him). Any (person) who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Day of Judgment, then indeed he has gone far, far astray"
