    "text": "And who can be more wicked than one who invents a lie against Allah, or says: \"I have received revelation,\" when he has received nothing, or (again the one) who says, \"I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed.\" And if you could only see how the wicked (are) in the flood of agonies at death! The angels stretch forth their hands, (as they say), \"Give up your souls: This day shall you receive your rewardâ€” A penalty of shame, because you used to tell lies against Allah, and scornfully reject His Signs (verses)"
