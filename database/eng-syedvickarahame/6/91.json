(It is) a light and a guidance to man: But you make it into (separate) sheets for show, while you hide much (of its contents): In there, you were taught that which you did not knowâ€” Neither you nor your fathers.\" Say: \"Allah (sent it down):\" Then leave them to sink into idle talk and meaningless remarks"
