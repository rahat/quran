But remind (them) thereby: That every soul takes itself to ruin by its own actions: It will find for itself no protector or benefactor (or intercessor) except Allah: If it offered every ransom, (or gift), none will be accepted: Such is (the end of) those who take themselves to ruin by their own acts: They will have (only) boiling water to drink, and for punishment, one most painful because they continued to disbelieve"
