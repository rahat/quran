    "text": "Those who give partners (to Allah) will say: \"If Allah had wished, we should not have given partners to Him, nor would our fathers; Nor should we have had any (of such) conducts.\" So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted Our might. Say: \"Have you any (certain) knowledge (or proof)? If so produce it before us. Surely, you follow nothing but (unsupported) thought: You do nothing but lie"
