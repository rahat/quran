Many of you did mislead from the men.\" Their friends among men will say: \"Our Lord! We profited from each other: But, we have reached (the end of) our termâ€” Which You did appoint for us.\" He will say: \"The Fire will be your dwelling place: You will live in there for ever, except as Allah wills. For your Lord is All Wise (Hakeem), All Knowing (Aleem)"
