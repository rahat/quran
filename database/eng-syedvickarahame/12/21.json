    "text": "And he (the man) in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: \"Make his stay (respectful and) honorable: Maybe he will bring us a lot of good, or we shall make him an adopted-son.\" Like this We made a place for Yusuf (Joseph) in the land, so that We might teach him the interpretations (the true meaning) of the stories (and events). And Allah has full power and control on His affairs; But most of mankind do not know it"
