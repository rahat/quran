Let a scribe (writer) write down faithfully as (a responsible person) between the parties: Let not the scribe refuse to write: As Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, (to the writer), but let him (who dictates) fear his Lord Allah and not reduce even a little of what he owes. If the party (who is) liable lacks mental capacity or (he is) weak, or unable himself to dictate, let his guardian dictate faithfully. And get two witnesses out of your own men, and if two men are not there then a man and two women, such as you choose for witnesses, so that if one makes a mistake, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (for evidence). Do not object to reduce to writing (your contract) of the future period, whether it be small or big: It is more just in the sight of Allah, more suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves. But if it be a transaction that you carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if you do not reduce it to writing but take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract; And let neither the writer nor the witness suffer harm. If you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah; For it is Allah Who teaches you. And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"
