    "text": "It is He, Who got out the unbelievers among the People of the Book (Scripture) from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). You did not think that they would get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (anger of) Allah came to them from sources that they had not expected, and He cast fear into their hearts, so that they demolished their houses by their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. Take warning, then, O you (people) with eyes (to see)"
