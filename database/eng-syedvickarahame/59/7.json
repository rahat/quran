    "text": "What Allah has granted (as booty) to His Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships, —Belongs to Allah, to His Messenger, —And to relatives and the orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not (merely) be circulated between the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger gives to you, and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; For Allah is Strict in punishment"
