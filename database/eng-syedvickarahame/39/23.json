    "text": "Allah has sent down (from time to time) the Most Beautiful Message, in the form of a Book, (the Scripture, this Quran) true within (and to) itself, (always) repeating (its teaching): The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver and tremble by (reading and hearing) it; Then their skins and their hearts soften by to the remembrance of Allah. Like this is the Guidance of Allah. He guides like this whom He pleases, but no one can guide those whom Allah leaves to wander about"
