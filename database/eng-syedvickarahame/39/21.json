    "text": "Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and leads it (the rain water) through springs in the earth? Then from it, He makes produce of various colors to grow: Then it fades (due to lack of water): (And) you will see it grow yellow; Then He makes it dry up and fall down. Truly, in this, there is a Message to remember for men of understanding"
