    "text": "You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (by blood relationship). For such (people who believe) He (Allah) has written Faith in their hearts, and (He has) strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live in there (for ever). Allah will be well pleased with them, and they (will be well pleased) with Him. They are the party of Allah. Truly, it is the party of Allah who will be successful (and the ultimate happiness)"
