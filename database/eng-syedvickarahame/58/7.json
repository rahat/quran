    "text": "Do you not see that Allah does know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret talk between three (persons), but He makes the fourth among them (with his knowledge)— Nor between (any) five but He makes the sixth— Nor between fewer nor more but He is with them, wherever they may be: And in the end, He will tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day Of Judgment. Verily, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"
