    "text": "Those men among you who make their wives unlawful to them (the men) by Zihar (a primitive and pagan custom of calling them mothers, see 33.4, these men know that) they (the wives) cannot be their mothers (of the men): None can be their mothers (of the men) except those who gave them birth. And in fact they (the men) use words (that are) unjust and false: But truly, Allah is All Pardoning (the sins), Often-Forgiving (Ghafoor)"
