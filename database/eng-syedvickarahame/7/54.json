    "text": "Indeed, your Guardian-Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then He rose over on the Throne (of authority): He draws the night as a veil over the day, each (day and night) searching the other in rapid sequence: And He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) governed by laws of His (divine) Order. Surely, is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed is Allah, the Lord (and the Cherisher) of all the Worlds (Rab-Al-'Ala'meen)"
