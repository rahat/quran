    "text": "We divided them into twelve Tribes or nations. We directed Musa (Moses) by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: \"Strike the rock with your (wooden) staff:\" Out of it gushed out twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of the clouds, and sent down to them (the gifts of) manna (something sweet like honey) and quails (small birds for their food), (saying): \"Eat from the good things We have given to you:\" (But they rebelled); To Us they did no harm, but they hurt their own themselves"
