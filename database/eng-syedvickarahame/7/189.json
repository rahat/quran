    "text": "It is He Who created you from a single person (Adam), and made his mate (Hawwa) of similar nature, that he might live with her (in peace and love). When they are close together, she bears a light burden (and responsibility) and carries it about (well and easily). When she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah their Lord, (saying): \"If You give us a good child, we promise we shall be grateful"
