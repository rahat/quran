    "text": "When Musa (Moses) came back to his people, angry and sad, said: \"It is evil, what you have done in my place (and) in my absence: Did you make haste to bring on (yourselves) the judgment (and anger) of your Lord?\" He threw the Tablets, held his brother (Haroon) by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to himself. Haroon (Aaron) said: \"Son of my mother! Indeed, the people truly treated me as nothing and came near to killing me! So do not make the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, and you do not count me with the people in sin"
