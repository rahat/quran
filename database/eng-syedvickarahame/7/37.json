For such (people), their punishment given must come to them from the Book (of Judgment): Until, when Our messengers (of death) come and take their souls, they say: \"Where are the things that you used to call other than Allah?\" They will reply: \"They have left us in a difficult position,\" and they will speak against themselves, that they had rejected Allah"
