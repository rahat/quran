    "text": "Those who follow the Messenger, Prophet (Muhammad), the unlettered who can neither read nor write, whom they find mentioned in their own (books)— In the Torah and the Gospel)— For he (the Prophet) commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; He allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the heavy yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light sent down with him— It is they who will prosper"
