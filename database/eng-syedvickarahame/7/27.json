Let not the Satan misguide you, in the same way that he got your parents out of the Garden, taking away from them their clothing, to expose their shameful (private) parts: Surely, he and his tribe (other jinns') watch you from a position that you cannot see them; Truly, we have made the Satans' as friends (only) of those without Faith"
