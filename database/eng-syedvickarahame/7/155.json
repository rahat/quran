    "text": "And Musa (Moses) chose from his people, seventy of his (best) men for Our place of meeting: When they were caught in severe earthquake, he prayed: \"O my Lord! If it was Your Will, you could have destroyed, much before, both them and me: Would You destroy us for the actions of the foolish ones among us? This is no more than Your trial: By it You make whom You will to lose the path, and You lead whom You will to the right path. You are our Protector:â€” So forgive us and give us Your mercy; For You are the Best of those who forgive"
