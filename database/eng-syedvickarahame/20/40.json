So We brought you (Moses) back to your mother, so that her eye might be cooled and she should not be sad. Then you did kill a man, but We saved you (O Musa!) from great suffering, and We tried you in many ways. Then you waited a number of years with the people of Madyan. Then you came here after the term I (Allah) had decided (for you), O Musa (Moses)"
