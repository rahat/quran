Say: \"Then do you take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as (those who) have no power, for good or for harm to themselves?\" Say: \"Is the blind and the one who sees equal? Or the depths of darkness and Light equal?” Or do they assign to Allah 'partners' who have created like His Creation, so that the creation seemed similar to them? Say: \"Allah is the Creator of all things: And He is The One (Al-Wah'id), the Supreme and Irresistible (Al-Qahhar)"
