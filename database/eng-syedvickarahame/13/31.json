Do the believers not know, that if Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the Right)? But for the disbelieversâ€” Disaster will never stop to grab them for their (ill) deeds, or fall close to their homes, until the promise of Allah has come true, because truly, Allah will not fail in His promise"
