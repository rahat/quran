    "text": "You (who believe!) know that the life of this world is but a play and amusement, self-praising and boasting (within yourselves), and multiplying, (in rivalry) among yourselves, riches and children. Here is a similarityâ€” Like a rain and the growth which it brings forth, give happiness (to the hearts of) the tillers; (But) soon it withers; You will see it grow yellow; Then it becomes dry and it crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a penalty severe (for those who follow wrong), and a Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure, (for those who love and worship Him). And what is the life of the world, but goods and possessions (objects) of deception"
