Not equal among you are those who spent (freely) and fought (the wars) before the Victory (of Makkah, with those who did so later). Those are higher in rank than those who spent (freely) and fought after (the Victory). But to all has Allah promised a best (reward). And Allah is familiar with all that you do"
