    "text": "(Here is) a story (of similarity) about the Paradise which the righteous (the pious believers) are promised: In it are rivers of water made pure and clean; Rivers of milk whose taste never changes; Rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; And rivers of honey, pure and clear. In it, there are for them all kinds of fruits; And forgiveness (and grace) from their Lord. (Can those in these Gardens) be compared to those who shall live, forever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their stomachs (to pieces)"
