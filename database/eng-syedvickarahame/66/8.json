Turn to Allah with sincere repentance: In the hope that your Lord will remove from you your sorrows and admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flowâ€” The Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him, their light will run before them and on their right hands, while they say, \"Our Lord!
