            "text": "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are strong against the unbelievers, (but) compassionate within themselves. You will see them bowing and prostrating themselves seeking Grace from Allah and (His) good pleasure. On their faces are their marks, the traces of their (prayerful) prostration. This is their trait (semblance) in the Torah; And their trait (semblance) in the Gospel, which is: Like a seed that sends forth its blade, it then becomes strong (and thick), and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers (corns of the seed) with wonder and delight. As a result it fills the unbelievers with anger at them. Allah has promised those from them who believe and do righteous good deeds forgiveness, and a great reward"
