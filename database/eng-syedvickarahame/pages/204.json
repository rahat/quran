Indeed, there is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on devotion (to Allah); It is more worthy of your standing forth (for prayer) in there. In it are men who love to be purified and cleansed; And Allah loves those who become pure and clean"

And it (the mosque) does break to pieces with him, into the fire of Hell. And Allah does not guide people who do wrong"

And who is truer to his promise than Allah? Then feel happy in the bargain that you have ended: That is the greatest success"
