Or the depths of darkness and Light equal?” Or do they assign to Allah 'partners' who have created like His Creation, so that the creation seemed similar to them?

And like this, from the (ore) which they heat (to melt) in the fire, to make ornaments or pots (and pans) from it, also there is a scum (or foam). Thus Allah clearly shows forth truth and vanity for the scum disappears when it is thrown out; Whereas what remains is for the good of mankind on the earth. Thus Allah does set forth examples (parables)"
