If there were no believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you were pushing aside and killed, and on whose account a crime would have resulted from you without (your) knowledge, (Allah would have allowed you to force your way, but He withheld your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they were identified, We, certainly would have punished the unbelievers among them with a painful punishment"

He knew what you did not know, and besides this, He granted a fast Victory"
