And let the (believers of) other party come up which have not yet prayed— And let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: Those who disbelieve wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to attack you in a single attack (or rush). But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; But take every precaution for yourselves. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers"
