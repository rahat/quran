But the self isolation and self-denial (practiced by monks in monasteries) which they made up for themselves, We did not place it upon them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the good Pleasure of Allah: But that they did not continue it as they should have done. So, We blessed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors"
