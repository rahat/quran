When Ibrahim (Abraham) said: \"My Lord is He Who gives life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and death.\" Ibrahim (Abraham) said: \"But it is Allah that causes the sun to rise from the East can you then cause it (the sun) to rise from the West.\" Thus the one who rejected faith was abashed. Allah does not give guidance to a people unjust"

How shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after its death?\" Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, after which He raised him up (again) from death. Allah said: \"How long did you remain (waiting so far)?\" He said: \"Perhaps a day or part of a day.\" He (Allah) said: \"No, you have waited like this for a hundred years: But look at your food and your drink; They show no signs of age: And look at your donkey: And that We may make for you a Sign for the people look further at the bones, how We bring them together and put flesh on them.\" When this was shown clearly to him, he said: \"I know that Allah is Able (Khadir) to do all things.\" (For a similar case of the Sleepers of Ephesus, see Ayat 18.9â€”)"
