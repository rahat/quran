If you (judges) do fear that they would be unable to keep the limits set forth by Allah, then there is no blame on either of them if she gives something for her freedom. These are the limits set by Allahâ€” So do not break them; If any (person) does step beyond the limits set forth by Allah, such persons wrong (themselves as well as others)"
