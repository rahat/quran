Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him) in repentance"

If it was not for a Word that reached them before from your Lord, (regarding) a period (for repentance) appointed, the matter would have been settled between them. And truly, those (the Jews and Christians) who have inherited the Book (of Message, Torah and Gospel) after them are in (uneasy and) suspicious doubt about it (the Quran)"
