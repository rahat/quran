We sent the Book (the Quran) in truth confirming the Scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: So judge between them (those who come to you) by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their useless wishes, going away from the Truth that has come to you. To each (of the prophets) among you We have prescribed a law (as in Torah and Gospel) and an Open Way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you (all) a single People, but (His plan is) to test you in what He has given you: So work hard as if (you are) in a race in all the good deeds. The goal for all of you is Allah: It is He Who will show you the truth of the matters in which you disagree"
