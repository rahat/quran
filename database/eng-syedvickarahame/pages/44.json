But to satisfy my own understanding.\" He (Allah) said: \"Take four birds; Tame them to turn (fly) to you; (Slaughter them into pieces and) put a portion of them (the birds) on every hill, and (then) call to them they will come to you (flying) with speed. Then know that Allah is Highest in Power, Wise"

They will be able to do nothing with the little they have earned. And Allah does not guide those who reject faith"
