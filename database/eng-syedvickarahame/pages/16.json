(These are two idolized men from the ancient times.) But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) without warning: \"We are only for trial; So do not disbelieve or curse.\" They learnt from them [Satans] the means to cause separation between man and wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. And they learnt that which harms them and helps them not and they knew that the buyers of (such magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And low was the price for which they sold their souls, if they only knew"
