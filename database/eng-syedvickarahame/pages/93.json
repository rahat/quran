If the dead person belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom you had a treaty of mutual understanding, then the compensation (or Diya) should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, he must fast of two months running (without breaks): By way of repentance to Allah: And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem), All Wise (Hakeem)"

When you go abroad in the cause of Allah, find out (everything) carefully, and do not say to anyone who offers you a greeting: \"You are not a believer!\" While wanting the perishable goods of the worldly life. With Allah are plenty of profits and spoils. Even though, you were yourselves (like this) before, till Allah conferred on you His favors: Therefore carefully find out everything (and detail). Verily, Allah is All Aware (Khabeer) of all that you do"
