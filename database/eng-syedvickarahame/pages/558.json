(Note: the Prophet himself never divorced any of his wives.) And fear Allah, your Lord: And turn them not out of their houses, nor shall they (themselves) leave except in case they are guilty of some clear and serious (sexual) misconduct. And these are the set-limits by Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set-limits of Allah, does indeed wrong his (own) soul: You do not know if by chance, Allah will bring about some new situation (later on)"

And take for witness two persons from among you, blessed with (a sense of) justice, and establish the evidence (as if you are) before Allah. Such is the guidance given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And for those who fear Allah, He (always) prepares a way out"
