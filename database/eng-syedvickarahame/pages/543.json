There is not a secret talk between three (persons), but He makes the fourth among them (with his knowledge)— Nor between (any) five but He makes the sixth— Nor between fewer nor more but He is with them, wherever they may be: And in the end, He will tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day Of Judgment. Verily, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"

And when they come to you, they greet and salute you, not as Allah salutes you, (but in crooked ways): And they say to themselves: \"Why does Allah not punish us for our words?\" Enough for them is Hell: In it they burn, and evil is that place to go"
