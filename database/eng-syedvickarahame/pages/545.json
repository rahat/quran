For such (people who believe) He (Allah) has written Faith in their hearts, and (He has) strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live in there (for ever). Allah will be well pleased with them, and they (will be well pleased) with Him. They are the party of Allah. Truly, it is the party of Allah who will be successful (and the ultimate happiness)"

But the (anger of) Allah came to them from sources that they had not expected, and He cast fear into their hearts, so that they demolished their houses by their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. Take warning, then, O you (people) with eyes (to see)"
