And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp, (requiring to shave, he should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice; And when you are in peaceful conditions (again), if anyone wishes to continue the Umrah on to Pilgrimage (Hajj), he must make an offering, what he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in (the immediate closeness to) the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is strict in punishment"
