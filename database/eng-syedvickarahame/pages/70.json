They said: \"What affair is this of ours?\" You say (to them): \"Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah’s.\" They hide in their minds what they dare not say to you. They say (to themselves): \"If we had anything to do with this affair, none of us should have been in the slaughter here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, for those whom death had to come, would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death;\" But (all of this was) because Allah might test what is in your chests; And purify what is in your hearts. And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) the secrets of your breasts (hearts)"

It is Allah Who gives Life and Death, and Allah is All Seeing (Baseer) all that you do"
