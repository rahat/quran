This day, those who reject Faith have given up all hope of (taking you away from) your religion: Yet do not fear them but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion for you. But if any (one) is forced by hunger, without any wish to disobey, Allah is truly Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
