When believing women come to you with an oath of their loyalty to you, (with a promise, pledging), that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with Allah, and that they will not steal, and that they will not commit adultery and that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, fabricating falsehood from their hands and feet, and that they will not disobey you in any goodly just matterâ€” Then, you accept their pledge (oath) of loyalty, and pray to Allah for the forgiveness (of their sins): Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
