    "text": "O you who believe! Do not take My enemies, and yours, as protecting friends (or protectors by) offering them (your) love, even though they disbelieve the Truth that has come to you: And have (on the contrary) driven the Messenger (the Prophet) and yourselves (from your homes), (simply) because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out to strive in My Way (Cause) and to seek My Good Pleasure, (take them not as protectors); Holding secret conversation of love with them: For I (Allah) completely know what you hide, and all that you reveal. And any of you who does this has strayed from the Straight Way"
