Let not some men among you laugh (and scoff) at others: It may be that they (the latter) are better than the former: Let not some women laugh at other women: It may be that the latter are better than the former: Nor defame nor be nasty to each other, nor call each other by (offensive) nicknames: Ill-seeming is a nickname: That implies wickedness, (if it is used by anyone) after he has believed: And those who do not repent (this practice) are (indeed) doing wrong"
