    "text": "If two parties among the believers fall into a quarrel, then you make peace between them both: But if one of them exceeds the bounds against the other, then (all of) you fight against the one who exceeds until it (the one) complies with the Command of Allah. Then if it (the one) complies, then make peace between them with justice, and be equitable and fair: Verily, Allah loves those who are fair (and just)"
