    "text": "O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion (as much as possible): Indeed some (types of) suspicion are sins: And do not spy on each other, do not speak ill of each other, behind their backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? No! You would hate it... But fear Allah: Verily, Allah is One Who accepts repentance (Tawwab), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
