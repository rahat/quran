    "text": "They ask you (O Prophet), concerning fighting in the Sacred Months (Muharam, Rajab, Zul-Quadah and Zul-Hajjah): Say: \"Fighting in there is a serious (offense): But in the sight of Allah it is more serious to prevent access to the Path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and to drive out its Members.\" Persecution and injustice are worse than killing. And they will not stop fighting you until they turn you back from your faith, if they can. And if any of you turn away from their Faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and the Hereafter; They will be companions of Fire and will abide in there"
