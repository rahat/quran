    "text": "The mothers should nurse their offspring for two whole years, if the father desires to complete their term. But he shall bear the cost of the mother's food and clothing with fairness and justice. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child. Nor father on account of his child, an heir shall be accountable in the same way. If they both decide on weaning by the agreement of both; After due consultation, there is no blame on them if you decide on a foster mother for your baby, there is no blame on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you offered, with fairness and justice. But fear Allah and know that Allah is All Seeing (Baseer) of all that you do"
