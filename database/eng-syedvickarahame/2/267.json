Give from the good things which you have (honorably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even receive anything bad (or dishonorable), in order that you may give away a part of it; Something, when you yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants (Ghani), and Worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
