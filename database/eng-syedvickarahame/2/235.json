    "text": "And there is no blame on you if you make an offer (a hint) of marriage or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that you admire them in your hearts: But do not make a secret contract with them except in honorable terms, and do not decide on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that Allah knows what is in your hearts, and so be fearful of Allah; And know that Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Forbearing (Haleem)"
