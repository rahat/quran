    "text": "And divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly (menstrual) periods. It is not lawful for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish to resolve the differences. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; But men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Almighty (Aziz), All Wise (Hakeem)"
