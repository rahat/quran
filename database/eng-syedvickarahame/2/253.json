    "text": "Those messengers: We preferred some of them, some above the others: To some of them (Moses), Allah spoke directly; Others (David), He raised to degrees (of honor); To Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave Clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit (Gabriel). If Allah had so willed, the following generations would not have fought among each other, after Clear (Signs) had come to them, but they (chose) to differ, some believing and others rejecting. If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other; But Allah fulfills His plan"
