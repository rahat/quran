    "text": "O you who believe! Cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity, or by injuryâ€” Like those who spend what they own to be seen of men, but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in the parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil; On it falls heavy rain which leaves it (just) a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with the little they have earned. And Allah does not guide those who reject faith"
