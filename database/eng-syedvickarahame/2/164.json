    "text": "Surely, in the creation of the heavens and the earth; In the alteration of the night and the day; In the sailing of the ships through the oceans for the benefit of mankind; In the rain which Allah sends down from the sky, and the life which He gives forth with it to an earth that is dead; In the beasts of all kinds, that He scatters through the earth; And in the change of the winds, and the clouds which they trail like the slaves between the sky and the earth; (Here) indeed are Signs for a people who are wise (and who are) understanding"
