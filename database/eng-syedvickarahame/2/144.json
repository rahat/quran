    "text": "(O Prophet!), We see your face turning to the heaven: (for guidance). Now shall We turn you to the Qibla, (the direction of prayer), that shall please you. Turn then your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah): And wherever you are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that this is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unmindful of what they do"
