    "text": "Allah! There is no god but He— The Living,— The Self-Sufficient,— The Infinitely Enduring,— Slumber or sleep never reaches Him. All things are His, in the heavens and on the earth. Who is there who can plead in His presence except as He permits? He knows what (appears to His creatures), before or after or behind them. They shall not understand the smallest fragment of His knowledge except as He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and over the earth, and He does not tire in guarding and preserving them; And He is the Most High (Al-A'li), the Supreme (Al-Azeem, in Glory). [This Holy Verse glorifying Allah is known as Ayat-ul-Kursi]"
