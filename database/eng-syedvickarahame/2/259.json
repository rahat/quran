    "text": "Or (take) the example of one who passed by a little township, all in ruins up to its roofs. He said: \"Oh! How shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after its death?\" Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, after which He raised him up (again) from death. Allah said: \"How long did you remain (waiting so far)?\" He said: \"Perhaps a day or part of a day.\" He (Allah) said: \"No, you have waited like this for a hundred years: But look at your food and your drink; They show no signs of age: And look at your donkey: And that We may make for you a Sign for the people look further at the bones, how We bring them together and put flesh on them.\" When this was shown clearly to him, he said: \"I know that Allah is Able (Khadir) to do all things.\" (For a similar case of the Sleepers of Ephesus, see Ayat 18.9â€”)"
