    "text": "And if a husband divorces his wife (a third time), then he cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and he has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits set forth by Allah. Such are the limits set by Allah, which He makes plain to those who understand"
