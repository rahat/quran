    "text": "A divorce is only permitted two times: After that the parties should either stay together on just terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (men) to take back any of your gifts (from your wives). Except when both parties fear that would be unable to keep the limits set forth by Allah. If you (judges) do fear that they would be unable to keep the limits set forth by Allah, then there is no blame on either of them if she gives something for her freedom. These are the limits set by Allahâ€” So do not break them; If any (person) does step beyond the limits set forth by Allah, such persons wrong (themselves as well as others)"
