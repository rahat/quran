    "text": "After (all of) this, you are the same people, who kill among yourselves, and banish a party of your people from their homes; Help (their enemies) against them, in guilt and hate; And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them though it was not right for you to remove them (from their homes). Is it only a part of the Book that you believe in? And do you reject the rest? But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this except disgrace in this life? And on the Day of Judgment they shall receive the most painful penalty. And Allah is aware of what you do"
