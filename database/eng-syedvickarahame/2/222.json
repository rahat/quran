    "text": "They ask you (O Prophet), concerning women's (menstrual) courses: Say: \"They are a hurt and a pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, you may approach them in any manner, time or place, ordained for you by Allah.\" Because Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean"
