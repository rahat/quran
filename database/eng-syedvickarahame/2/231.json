    "text": "And when you divorce women, and they fulfill the term of their waiting period (of three monthly courses), either take them back on just and fair terms or set them free on just and fair terms; But do not take them back to hurt them, (or) to take undue advantage (of them); If anyone does that, he wrongs his own soul. Do not treat Allah’s Signs lightly— But sincerely recite Allah’s favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction. And fear Allah and know that Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"
