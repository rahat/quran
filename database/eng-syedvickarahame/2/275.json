    "text": "Those who eat from (items including moneys that they receive as) interest, will not stand except as stands one whom The Satan by his touch has driven to madness. That is because they say: \"Trade is like usury,\" But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving the direction from their Lord, do not receive (usury), shall be forgiven for the past; Their case is for Allah (to judge) but those who repeat (receiving usury) are companions of the Fire: They will live in there (for ever)"
