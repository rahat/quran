    "text": "And if you divorce them (the women) before the marital relation but after fixing a dower for them, then the half of the dower (is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; And the remission (of the man's half) is the closest to the right conduct. And do not forget to be generous between yourselves because Allah is All Seeing (Baseer) of all that you do"
