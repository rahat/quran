    "text": "Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and you are their garments. Allah knows what you secretly did among yourselves; But He turned to you and forgave you; So now associate with them (your wives), and seek what Allah has made lawful to you and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from its black thread (darkness); Then complete your fast till the night appears but do not associate with your wives while you are in retreat in the mosques. These are limits (set by) Allah; Approach them not in its neighborhood. Thus does (He) make clear His Signs to men: That they may learn self-control"
