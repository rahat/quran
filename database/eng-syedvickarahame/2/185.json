    "text": "The month of Ramadan is the (month) in which was sent down the Quran as a guide to mankind, also Clear (Signs for) guidance and judgment (between right and wrong); So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting. But, if any one is ill or on a journey, the prescribed period (should be made up) by days later. Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period. And to glorify Him because He has guided you; And for this reason, you should be grateful to Him"
