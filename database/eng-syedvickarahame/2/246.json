    "text": "Have you not turned your vision to the groups of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa (Moses)? They said to a prophet (who was) among them (Samuel): \"Appoint a king for us, that we may fight in the cause of Allah.\" He said: \"Is it not possible that, if you were commanded to fight, you may not fight?\" They said: \"How could we refuse to fight in the Cause of Allah after seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?\" But when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except for a small band among them. But Allah has full knowledge of those who do wrong"
