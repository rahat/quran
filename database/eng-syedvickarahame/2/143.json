    "text": "Thus have We made of you (believers) a nation of Muslims (followers of faith) justly balanced, that you may be witnesses over the nations, and the Prophet (Muhammad), a witness over yourselves; And We had appointed Qibla (the direction of prayer) to which you were used, only to test those who followed the Prophet (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (from the Faith). indeed it was (a change) momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And Allah would never make your faith ineffective. Most surely, Allah is for the mankind Full of Kindness (Ra'uf), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
