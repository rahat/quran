    "text": "And do not marry unbelieving women (idolaters), until they believe; And indeed, a slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she (may) allure you. And do not marry (your girls) to non-believers until they believe: A slave man who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he (may) allure you. non believers (only) call you to the Fire. But Allah calls (you) by His Grace to the Garden (of Joy) and Forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind that they may celebrate His Praise"
