    "text": "Mankind was a single nation, and Allah sent messengers with glad tidings and warning; And with them He sent down the Book in Truth to judge between people in matters where they (the people) differed: but the People of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among themselves, except those with selfishness and rejection. Allah by His Grace guided the believers to the Truth concerning that in what they differed. And Allah guides whom He wills to a Straight Path"
