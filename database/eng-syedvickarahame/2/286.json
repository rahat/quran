Forgive us if we forget or make mistakes (on our part.)\" (Pray:) \"Our Lord! Place not on us a burden like that which You placed on those before us; Our Lord! Place not on us a burden greater than we have the strength to bear. Wipe out our sins, and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Protector (Maula, Benefactor): Help us against those who stand against Faith"
