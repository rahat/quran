I have made some of my children to live in the valley without (any) cultivation to (be near) Your Sacred House (in Makkah); So that, O our Lord, they may establish regular Prayer: So fill the hearts of some from among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: So that they may offer thanks (to You)"
