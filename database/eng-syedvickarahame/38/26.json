Verily, We truly made you a successor and leader on earth: So you judge between men in truth (and justice): And do not follow the (idle) desires (of your heart), for they will take you away from the Path of Allah: Verily, those who go away from the Path of Allah, (there) is a painful penalty, because they forget the Day of Reckoning (and Account)"
