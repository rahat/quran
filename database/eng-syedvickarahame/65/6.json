And if they carry (life in their wombs), then spend (your sustenance) on them until they deliver their burden: And if they suckle your (offspring) for you, give them their recompense: And mutually consult together, according to what is just and reasonable. And if you find yourselves in difficulties for one another, let another woman suckle (the child) on the (fathers) behalf"
