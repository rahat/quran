    "text": "O Prophet! When you (Muslims) divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed periods, and count their prescribed periods (accurately). (Note: the Prophet himself never divorced any of his wives.) And fear Allah, your Lord: And turn them not out of their houses, nor shall they (themselves) leave except in case they are guilty of some clear and serious (sexual) misconduct. And these are the set-limits by Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set-limits of Allah, does indeed wrong his (own) soul: You do not know if by chance, Allah will bring about some new situation (later on)"
