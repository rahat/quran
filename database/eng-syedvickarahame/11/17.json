    "text": "Can they be (like) those (Muslims) who accept a Clear (Message, the Quran) from their Lord, and whom a witness (Gabriel) from (Allah) Him(self) recites (and follows) it, like the Book of Musa (Moses) before it— A Guide and a Mercy? They believe in it; But those of the Sects that reject it— The Fire will be their promised meeting-place. So do not be in doubt about it: Verily, it is the Truth from your Lord: But many among men do not believe"
