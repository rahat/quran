Tell me if I have a clear (proof) from my Lord, and He has given me good (and pure) livelihood from Himself, (shall I corrupt it with unjust money?), I do not wish to do what I forbid you to do. I only wish for (your) betterment to the best of my power (and ability); And my guidance can only come from Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I look in repentance"
