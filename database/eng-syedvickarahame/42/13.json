    "text": "The same religion has He established for you as the one which He brought to Nuh (Noah)— And that which We have revealed to you— And that which We brought to Ibrahim (Abraham), to Musa (Moses), and to Isa (Jesus): And that is, that you should remain steadfast in religion, and make no division within it: For those (people) who worship things other than Allah, the (Straight Way) to which you call them, is hard. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him) in repentance"
