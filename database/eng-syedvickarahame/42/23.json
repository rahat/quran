Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me in the love and kinship.\" And if anyone earns any good and righteous deeds, We shall give him an increase in the good (that he has earned in proper measure): Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Appreciative (Ash-Shukoor, of the service from His servants)"
