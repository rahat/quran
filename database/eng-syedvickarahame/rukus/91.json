They change words from their right times and (from their right) places: They say, \"If you are given this, take it, but if not, be aware!\" If anyone's trial is intended by Allah, you (O Prophet!) have no authority in the least over him to protect from Allah. For such (people) — It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and a severe punishment in the Hereafter"
