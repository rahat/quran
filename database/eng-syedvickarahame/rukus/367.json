Do not enter the Prophet’s houses— Unless permission is given to you— (If you go) for a meal, do not be (so early as) to wait for its preparation: But when you are invited, enter (his house); And when you have taken your meal, go away, without trying to get into idle talk. Verily, such (behavior) does not please the Prophet: And he is (too) shy to ask you to leave, but Allah is not shy (to tell you) the truth. And when you ask (his ladies) for anything you may want, ask them with a screen between (them and you): That allows greater purity in your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you that you may displease Allah’s Messenger (Muhammad), nor that you may marry his widows after him (after his death at any time). Truly, in Allah’s sight, such a thing is an enormous and evil act"
