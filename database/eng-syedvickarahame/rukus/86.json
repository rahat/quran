But when you are away from the Sacred Grounds and (out) of the pilgrim clothes (I’hram ), you may hunt: And let not the hate of some people who (earlier) shut you out of the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah) lead you to overstepping your (own) limits (and bitterness on your part). You help one another in righteousness and in good deeds, but do not help one another in sin and evil: Fear Allah: Because Allah is strict in punishment"

This day, those who reject Faith have given up all hope of (taking you away from) your religion: Yet do not fear them but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion for you.
