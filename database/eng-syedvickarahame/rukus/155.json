And as to those who believed but did not leave their homes (or emigrate in Hijrah), you have no duty to protect them, until they do emigrate (and come into your protection); But if they ask for your help in religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance (agreement or friendship).
