If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah has made clear, they are (no better than) disbelievers"

To each (of the prophets) among you We have prescribed a law (as in Torah and Gospel) and an Open Way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you (all) a single People, but (His plan is) to test you in what He has given you: So work hard as if (you are) in a race in all the good deeds.
