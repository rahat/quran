It is not lawful for you, (men) to take back any of your gifts (from your wives). Except when both parties fear that would be unable to keep the limits set forth by Allah. If you (judges) do fear that they would be unable to keep the limits set forth by Allah, then there is no blame on either of them if she gives something for her freedom. These are the limits set by Allah— So do not break them; If any (person) does step beyond the limits set forth by Allah, such persons wrong (themselves as well as others)"

Do not treat Allah’s Signs lightly— But sincerely recite Allah’s favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction.
