They are not lawful (wives) for the unbelievers, nor are the (unbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them. But pay the unbelievers what they have spent (on their dowry). And there will be no sin (or blame) on you, if you marry them on payment of their dowry to them. But do not hold the guardianship of unbelieving women: Ask for what you have spent for their dowry, and let the (unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on their dowers of women who have come to you). Such is the Judgment (the Command) of Allah: He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem), All Wise (Hakeem)"
