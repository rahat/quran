When Ibrahim (Abraham) said: \"My Lord is He Who gives life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and death.\" Ibrahim (Abraham) said: \"But it is Allah that causes the sun to rise from the East can you then cause it (the sun) to rise from the West.\" Thus the one who rejected faith was abashed. Allah does not give guidance to a people unjust"
