Did you say to men, ‘Worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah’?\" He (Isa) will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would indeed have known it. You know what is in my heart, even though I do not know what is in Yours. Truly, You fully know all that is hidden and unseen"
