    "text": "O you who believe! (In case) any from among you turns back from his Faith (in Islam, be sure that), soon Allah will produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him— (People who are) humble with the believers, strong against the Rejecters (of Faith) fighting in the Way (the Cause) of Allah, and never afraid of the (unpleasant) words from those who find fault. That is the Grace of Allah, which He will bestow on whom He pleases. And Allah is All Encompassing and Sufficient (Wasi’), All Knowing (Aleem)"
