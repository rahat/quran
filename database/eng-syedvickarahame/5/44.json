    "text": "Verily, it was We Who sent down the Torah (to Moses): There was guidance and light in it. By its teachings, the Jews have been judged by the prophets who bowed to Allah’s Will— (in submission), by the Rabbis, and by the Doctors of (Judaic) Law: Because the protection of Allah’s Book was given to them and they were witness to it: Therefore do not fear men, but fear Me, and do not sell My Signs for a low price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah has made clear, they are (no better than) disbelievers"
