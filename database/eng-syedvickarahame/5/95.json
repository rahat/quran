    "text": "O you who believe! Kill not game (for sport or for food) while in the Sacred Grounds (of the Holy Mosque) or (while being) in pilgrim clothes (or I’hram). If any of you does so knowingly, the compensation is an Offering, brought to the Ka’bah, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as decided by two just men from yourselves; Or by way of making up (the peace), the feeding of the needy, or its equivalent in fasts; That he may taste the penalty of his deed. Allah forgives what is past: For repeating (such acts) Allah will take from him the penalty. And Allah is Almighty (Aziz), and Lord of Retribution (Zun-Inthiqam)"
