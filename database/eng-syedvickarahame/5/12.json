And Allah said: \"I am with you if you (only) establish regular Prayers, practice regular Charity believe in My messengers, honor and help them, and (offer a) loan to Allah a beautiful loan; Surely I will take away your evils from you, and admit you to the Gardens with rivers flowing below; But after this if any of you, stands against (and opposes) faith, he has truly gone away from the path of justice (and honesty)"
