    "text": "O you who believe! Do not change the holiness of the (sacred) Symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred Month of Ramadan, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor of the garlands (for such animals or of the people), nor of the people coming to the Sacred House (in Makkah) seeking the bounty and the good pleasure of their Lord. But when you are away from the Sacred Grounds and (out) of the pilgrim clothes (Iâ€™hram ), you may hunt: And let not the hate of some people who (earlier) shut you out of the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah) lead you to overstepping your (own) limits (and bitterness on your part). You help one another in righteousness and in good deeds, but do not help one another in sin and evil: Fear Allah: Because Allah is strict in punishment"
