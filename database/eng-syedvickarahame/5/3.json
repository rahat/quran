    "text": "Forbidden to you (for food) are: Dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been pronounced the name of (any) other than Allah; And that which has been killed by choking or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being (repeatedly) stabbed to death; And that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; Unless you are able to slaughter it (in due form); And that which is sacrificed on stone (alters); (Forbidden) also is the division (of meats) by tearing apart with arrows (for luck): That is impiety. This day, those who reject Faith have given up all hope of (taking you away from) your religion: Yet do not fear them but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion for you. But if any (one) is forced by hunger, without any wish to disobey, Allah is truly Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
