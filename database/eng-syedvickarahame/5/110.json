I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit (Gabriel) so that you did speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Look! I taught you the Book and Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel, and when you made out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My leave, and you healed those (who were) born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And when you brought forth the dead, by My leave; And when I did restrain the Children of Israel from (harming) you; When you did show them the Clear Signs, and the disbelievers among them said: ‘This is nothing but clear magic.’"
