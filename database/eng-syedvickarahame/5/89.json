    "text": "Allah will not ask you to account for what is unintentional in your oath; But He will ask you to account for your deliberate oath: To make up (in such cases), feed ten needy persons, on a scale of the average food of your families; Or clothe them; Or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is to make up (or compensate) for the oath you have sworn. But keep to your oath, like this Allah does make clear to you His Signs, that you may be thankful"
