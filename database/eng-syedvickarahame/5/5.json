(Lawful for you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but also chaste women among the People of the Book (that was) sent down before your timeâ€” Provided you give them their due dowers, and wish purity, not (illicit or lustful) desire, nor secret (and illegal) relations, nor as \"women friends.\" If anyone rejects Faith, then his work is useless, and in the Hereafter he will be among the ranks of the losers (of all spiritual reward)"
