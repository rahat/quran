    "text": "O you who believe! When death comes near any of you, (take) witnesses among yourselves when making (legal or last time) changes— Entrust two just men from your own (community) or others from outside, if you are traveling through the earth (world), and the chance of death comes to you (thus). If you doubt (their truthfulness) make them both stay after prayer, and let them both swear by Allah: “We do not wish for any worldly gain in this (matter) even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: We shall not hide the evidence before Allah if we did, then look! The sin (will) be upon us!”"
