    "text": "O Messenger (Muhammad)! Do not let those (people) make you sad, (those) who go faster than the others towards disbelief: (Whether it be) among those who say, \"We believe\", with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; Or it be among the Jews— Men who will listen to any lie— (Men who) will listen even to others who have never even come to you. They change words from their right times and (from their right) places: They say, \"If you are given this, take it, but if not, be aware!\" If anyone's trial is intended by Allah, you (O Prophet!) have no authority in the least over him to protect from Allah. For such (people) — It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and a severe punishment in the Hereafter"
