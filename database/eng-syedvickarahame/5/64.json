    "text": "The Jews say: \"Allahâ€™s hand is tied up.\" Be (it is) their hands (that are) tied up and (let) them be cursed for the (lies) they say (against Allah!). No! Both His hands are widely stretched out: He gives and spends as He pleases. Surely, the Message that comes to you from Allah increases in many of them, their rebellion and disbelief (against Allah). Among them We have placed opposition and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they light a fire for war, Allah extinguishes it: But they (always) work hard in doing mischief on earth. And Allah does not love those who do mischief"
