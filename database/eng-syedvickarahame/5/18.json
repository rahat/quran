    "text": "(Both) the Jews and the Christians say: \"We are sons of God, and His beloved.\" Say: \"Why then does He punish you for your sins? No, you are only men (mere human beings)â€” Of the (other) men He has created: He forgives whom He pleases, and He punishes whom He pleases: And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between: And to Him is the final goal (of all)"
