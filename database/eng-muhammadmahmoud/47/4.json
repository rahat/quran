    "text": "So when you meet the ones who have disbelieved, then it is striking of the necks until, when you have subjugated (Wrongly understood by Arberry and others to mean \"slaughter\") them, then uphold the bonds; (i.e., take them captives) then (it is) either being bounteous (i.e., \"showing\" bounty by setting them free) hereafter (to them), or (exacting) ransom, until the war lays down its encumbrances. So it shall be; and if Allah had (so) decided, He would have vindicated Himself upon them; but that He may try some of you by means of others (Literally: by means of some \"others\"). And the ones who have been killed in the way of Allah, then He will never send their deeds into error"
