    "text": "(This) is the similitude of the Garden which the pious have been promised; therein are rivers of water not staling, and rivers of milk that does not change in taste, and rivers of wine- a delicious (drink) to the drinkers- and rivers of honey unadulterated; (Literally: carefully selected; clear; limpid, strained) and therein for them are all kinds of products, (i.e., fruits) and forgiveness from their Lord. Are they as he who is eternally (abiding) in the Fire, such as are made to drink scalding water so it cuts up their bowels"
