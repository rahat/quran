    "text": "They are (the ones) who disbelieved and barred you from the Inviolable Mosque and (barred) the consecrated offering (also) from reaching its lawful destination. And had it not been for (some) believing men and (some) believing women whom you did not know, (for fear) that you should trample (i.e., kill them) them, and so dishonor would afflict you on their account without (your) knowing it, that Allah may cause whomever He decides to enter into His mercy. If they (i.e., believers and disbelivers) had been made clearly distinct, indeed We would have tormented the ones who disbelieved among them with a painful torment"
