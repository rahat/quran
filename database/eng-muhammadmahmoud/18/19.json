A speaker from among them said, \"How long have you lingered?\" They said, \"We have lingered a day, or part (Literally: some \"part\" of a day) of a day.\" (Others) said, \"Your Lord knows best how long you have lingered. So send one of you forth with this money to the city, then let him look for whichever of them has the purest (Literally: most cleansed) food, so let him come up to you with a provision thereof, and let him be courteous, and definitely let no man be aware of your (presence)"
