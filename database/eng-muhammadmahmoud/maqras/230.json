He knows that you (The believers, This and the following pronouns are plural) will never enumerate it; so He has relented towards you. Then read of the Qur'an that which is easy (for you). He knows that (some) of you are sick, and others striking in the earth, (i.e., traveling) seeking a share of the Grace of Allah, and others fighting in the way of Allah. So read of it that which is easy (for you). And keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat, and lend to Allah a fair loan. And whatever charity you will forward to your selves, you will find (it) in the Providence of Allah; it will be more charitable (i.e., better) and more magnificent in reward. And ask the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
