    "text": "O you paternal Prophet, surely We have made lawful for you your spouses to whom you have brought their rewards, and what your right hand possesses of what Allah has conceded you (as war prisoners), and the daughters of your paternal uncle, and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncle, and the daughters of your maternal aunts maternal who have emigrated with you, and (any) believing woman (Literally: wife) in case she bestows herself to the Prophet, in case the Prophet is willing to marry her. (Or: marry her anyone) (This is) for you exclusively, apart from the believers. We already know what We have ordained upon them concerning their spouses and what their hands possess, so that there may be no restriction on you. And Allah has been Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
