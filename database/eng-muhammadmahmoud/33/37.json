    "text": "And as you (This is addressed to the prophet) have said to him on whom Allah has (graciously) favored and you have (much) favored, \"Retain your spouse to yourself, and be pious to Allah, \" and you were concealing within yourself what Allah would display, and being apprehensive of mankind; and Allah truly has better right for you to be apprehensive of Him. So, as soon as Zayd had accomplished what he would of her, (i.e., accomplished his purpose, and divorced her. The reference is to Zaynab) We espoused her to you so that there should not be any restriction for the believers concerning the spouses of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished what they would of them; and the Command of Allah has been performed"
