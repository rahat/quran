    "text": "In no way has Allah made to any man two hearts within the hollow (of his breast); and in no way has He made your spouses whom you (declare) as your mother's back (i.e., divorce by Dhihar, a pre-Islamic form of divorc) (truly) your mothers; and in no way has He made your adopted sons your sons (in fact). That (Literally: temptation; i.e., if the hypocrites had been asked to apostatize from Islam) is your saying, (the words) of your mouths; and Allah says the Truth, and He guides on the way"
