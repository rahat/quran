    "text": "Know that the present life (Literally: the lowly life i.e., the life of this world) is only playing and diversion, and an adornment, and a cause for mutual boasting among you, and mutual multiplying in riches and children. It is as the likeness of succoring (rain) whose growth (looks) wonderful to the steadfast disbelievers. Thereafter it heaves, then you see it (turning) yellow; thereafter it becomes crushed to pieces. And in the Hereafter there is strict torment and forgiveness from Allah and all-blessed Satisfaction; and in no way is the present life anything except the enjoyment of delusion"
