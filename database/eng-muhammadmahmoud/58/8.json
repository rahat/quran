Thereafter they go back to what they were forbidden, and they confer privately together in vice and hostility, and in disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to you, (The Prophet) they greet you with a greeting Allah has not greeted you with; and they say within themselves, \"Had (your warning been true Allah would torment us for what we say!\" Enough reckoning for them will be Hell, at which they will be to roast. Miserable then is the Destiny)"
