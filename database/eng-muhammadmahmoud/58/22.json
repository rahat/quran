    "text": "You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for the ones who contravene Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kinsmen. (As for) those, He has written belief in their hearts, and He has aided them with a Spirit from Himself; and He will cause them to enter Gardens from beneath which rivers run, eternally (abiding) therein. Allah is satisfied with them, and they are satisfied with Him. Those are the party of Allah; verily the party of Allah are surely they (who) are the prosperers"
