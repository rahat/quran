In no way can there be a private conference among three (persons), except that He is the fourth of them, nor five (persons), except that He is the sixth of them, nor lesser than that, nor more except that He is with them, wherever they may be; thereafter He will fully inform them of whatever they have done, on the Day of the Resurrection. Surely Allah is Ever-Knowing of everything"
