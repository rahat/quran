    "text": "The ones of you who back away from their women, (i.e. their wives, to whom the husbands say, \"Be as my mother's back.\" This is called ahihar, a pre-Islamic from of divorce) in no way are they their mothers; decidedly their mothers are none except those who gave birth (to) them, and surely they are saying a maleficent saying and a forgery. And surely Allah is indeed Ever-Clement, Ever-Forgiving"
