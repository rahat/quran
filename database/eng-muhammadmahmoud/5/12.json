And Allah said, \"Surely I am with you, indeed in case you keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat, (i.e., pay the poor-dues) and believe in My Messengers, and rally to them in assistance, and lend to Allah a fair loan, indeed I will definitely expiate for you your odious deeds, and indeed I will definitely cause you to enter Gardens from beneath which Rivers run. So whoever of you disbelieves after that, then he has already erred away from the level way"
