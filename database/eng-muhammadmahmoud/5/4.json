Say, \"The good things are made lawful to you, and (such) hunting creatures as you teach, (training them) as hounds, teaching them (part) of what Allah has taught you.\" So eat of whatever they hold back for you, and mention the Name of Allah over it. And be pious to Allah, surely Allah is swift at the reckoning"
