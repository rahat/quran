    "text": "Surely We sent down the Tawrah, wherein there is a guidance and a light, thereby the Prophets who had become Muslims (Literally: who had surrendered themselves to Allah) gave judgment to the ones who Judaized, and (so) did the rabbis and the doctors (of the Law), according to whatever they were asked to preserve of the Book of Allah, and were witnesses to. So do not be apprehensive of mankind, and be apprehensive of Me, and do not trade My signs for a little price. And whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down, then those are they (who are) the disbelievers"
