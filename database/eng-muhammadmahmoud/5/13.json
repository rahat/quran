They pervert the Wordings from their contexts, (i.e. original meanings) and they have forgotten a portion of what they were reminded. And you will not cease viewing some treacherous (act) on their part, except a few of them. Yet be clement towards them and pardon; surely Allah loves the fair-doers"
