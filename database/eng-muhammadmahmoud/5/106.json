    "text": "O you who have believed, the testimony between you, when death is present to any of you while bequeathing, shall be two (men) with (i.e. owning) a sense of justice or two others from other (folk), in case you are striking in the earth (i.e., traveling) so the affliction of death afflicts you. You shall detain them (both) after the prayer (s), then they shall swear by Allah, in case you are suspicious, \"We will not trade it for a price, even if it were a near kinsman, nor will we keep back the testimony of Allah, (for) lo, surely in that case we are indeed of the vicious (people)"
