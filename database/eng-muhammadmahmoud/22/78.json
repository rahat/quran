    "text": "And strive for Allah as is the true striving for Him. He is (The One) Who has selected you, and in no way has (He) made for you (any) restriction in the religion, (being) the creed of your fatherIbrahim (Abraham). He is (The One) Who has named you Muslims earlier and in this (Book) that the Messenger may be a constant witness against you, and that you may be constant witnesses against mankind. So keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat (i.e., pay the poor-dues) and adhere firmly to Allah; He is your Patronizer; so how favorable is The Patronizer, and how favorable is The Ready Vindicator"
