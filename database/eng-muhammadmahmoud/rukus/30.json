So, in case you fear that they may not keep within (Literally: Keep up) the bounds of Allah, it is no fault in them (both) for her to ransom herself.

(i.e., by obliging them to relinquish part or all of their dower to you) And whoever performs that, then he has already done injustice to himself; And do not take to yourselves the signs of Allah in mockery (among yourselves); and remember the favor of Allah upon you, and whatever He has sent down on you of the Book and (the) Wisdom to admonish you.
