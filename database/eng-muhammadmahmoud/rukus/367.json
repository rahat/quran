(i.e., its hour, its time) But when you are invited, then enter. So, when you have had food, then disperse yourselves, neither (announcing yourselves) into familiar discourse. Surely that (Literally: those) hurts the Prophet, so he (feels) shy before you; and Allah does not shy from the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for any article, then ask them from behind a curtain; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And in no way should you hurt the Messenger of Allah, nor marry his spouses even after him at all. Surely that would, in the Reckoning of Allah, be a monstrous (thing)"
