And to (both) his (i.e., the deceased's) parents, to each one of the two is the sixth of whatever he has left in case he has children; then in case he has no children, and his parents are his heirs, then a third is to his mother; (yet) in case he has brothers, then to his mother is the sixth, even after any bequest he may bequeath, or any debt. Your fathers and your sons (Or: children) - you do not realize which of them is nearer in profit to you. (This is) an ordinance from Allah; surely Allah has been Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
