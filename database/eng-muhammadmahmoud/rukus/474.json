It is as the likeness of succoring (rain) whose growth (looks) wonderful to the steadfast disbelievers. Thereafter it heaves, then you see it (turning) yellow; thereafter it becomes crushed to pieces. And in the Hereafter there is strict torment and forgiveness from Allah and all-blessed Satisfaction; and in no way is the present life anything except the enjoyment of delusion"
