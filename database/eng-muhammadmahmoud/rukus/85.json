(And) in case they are two (sisters), then they shall have two thirds of what he has left; and in case they are brothers, men and women, (i.e., has the right to all the inheritance) then the male shall have the same portion as that of two females. Allah makes (this) evident to you, that you should not err; and Allah is Ever-Knowing of everything"
