    "text": "In case you disbelieve, then surely Allah is Ever-Affluent (Literally: Ever-Rich) to do without you, and He is not satisfied with disbelief from His bondmen. And in case you thank (Him), He is satisfied with it for you. And no encumbered self (can) be encumbered with the encumberance of another. Thereafter to your Lord (is) your return; then He will fully inform you of whatever you were doing. Surely He is Ever-Knowing of the (inmost thoughts) within the breasts. (Literally: what the breasts own)"
