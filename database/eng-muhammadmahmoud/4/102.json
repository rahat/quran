    "text": "And when you are among them, (and) so keep up the prayer for them, then let a section of them be upright with you, and let them take their weapons (i.e., to defend those who pray and to face the enemy) So, when they have prostrated themselves, (i.e., finished their prayer) then let them be in your rear-guard; and let another section who have not prayed come up (and) so let them pray with you, and let them take their wary (precautions) and their weapons. The ones who have disbelieved would like you to be heedless of your weapons and your belongings, then they would incline (Or: be hostile to) against you once for all. (Literally: in one inclining; or in one hostility) And there is no fault in you, in case you are hurt by rain or you are sick, to lay aside your weapons and take your wary (precautions). Surely Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a degrading torment"
