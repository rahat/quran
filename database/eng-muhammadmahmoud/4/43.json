    "text": "O you who have believed, do not draw near to prayer (when) you are drunken until you know what you are saying, nor (when) you are ritually unclean, (i.e. unclean through the emission of semen, or sexual discharge \"in woman\") except when you are traversing a way, until you have washed yourselves. And in case you are sick, or on a journey, or (in case) any of you comes from the privy, or you have had contact with women, yet you have not found water, so have recourse to good soil, (i.e. a high dry place, a mounting place) then wipe (most of) your faces and hands. Surely Allah has been Ever-Clement, Ever-Forgiving"
