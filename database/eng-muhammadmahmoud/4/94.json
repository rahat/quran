    "text": "O you who have believed, when you strike (i.e. journey in the earth) in the way of Allah, then be discerning, and do not say to him who offers you the salutation, (Literally: casts the salutation, saying, \"peace be upon you!\") \"You are not a believer, \" inequitably seeking the advantage of the present (Literally: this lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) life; then in the Providence of Allah is plenteous booty. Thus you were earlier, then Allah has been bounteous to you, so be discerning. Surely Allah has been Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
