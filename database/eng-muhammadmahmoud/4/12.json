    "text": "And for you is a half of whatever your spouses have left, in case they have no children; (yet) in case they have children, then for you is the fourth of whatever they have left, (only) after any bequest they may have bequeathed, (Literally: enjoined) or any debt. And for them is a fourth of whatever you have left, in case you have no children; yet in case you have children, then they have an eighth of whatever you have left, (only) after any bequest you may have bequeathed, or any debt. And in case a man or a woman has no heir direct, and has a brother or a sister, then to each one of the two is the sixth; yet in case they are more numerous than that, then they shall be sharers in the third, (only) after any bequest may have been bequeathed, or any debt, without harming (others). (This is) an injunction from Allah; and Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Forbearing"
