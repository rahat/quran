And if Allah had (so) decided, He would indeed have given them authority over you; then they would indeed have fought you. So, in case they keep apart from you; (and) so did not fight you, and offer (Literally: cast forth) you submissiveness, then in no way does Allah allow (Literally: in no way makes any way for you) you a way against them"
