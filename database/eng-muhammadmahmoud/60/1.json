    "text": "O you who have believed, do not take to yourselves My enemy and your enemy for patrons, casting forth to them (your) amity, and they have already disbelieved in what has come to you of the Truth, driving the Messenger and you (too) for that you believe in Allah, your Lord, in case you have gone out striving in My way and seeking My Supreme Satisfaction, secretly having amity towards them. And I know best whatever you conceal and whatever you make public; and whoever of you performs it, then he has already erred away from the level way"
