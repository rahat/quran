    "text": "O you who have believed, when female believers come to you as migrants (i.e., those who have left their homes. The Arabic word means both emigrants and immigrants) then test them Allah best knows their belief. So in case you know them to be believers, then do not return them to the steadfast disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) to the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them. And bring (the disbelievers) what they have expended; and there is no fault in you to marry them (The female believers) when you have brought them (The female believers) their (due) rewards. And do not hold back the ties (i.e., marriage bonds) of the disbelieving women and ask what you have expended, (i.e., do not keep disbelieving women as wives; ask for the return of the dower you paid to them) and let them (The pronoun is masculine plural; i.e., the disbelievers) ask what they (The pronoun is masculine plural; i.e., the disbelievers) have expended. That is the Judgment of Allah; He judges between you; and Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
