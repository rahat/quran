If you had so decided, You would have caused them to perish earlier and me. Would You cause us to perish for what the foolish ones of us have performed? Decidedly it is (nothing) except Your temptation, whereby You lead to error whomever You decide, and You guide whomever You decide. You are our Ever-Patronizing Patron, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are The Most Charitable of forgivers"
