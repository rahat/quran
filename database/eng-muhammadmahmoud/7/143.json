    "text": "And as soon as Musa came to Our fixed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"Lord! Show me, that I may look at You!\" Said He, \"You will never see Me; but look at the mountain, so, in case it stays residing in its place, then you will eventually see Me.\" Then as soon as his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He made it pounded (into dust), and Musa collapsed stunned. So, as soon as he recovered, he said, All Extolment be to You! I repent to You, and I am the first of the believers"
