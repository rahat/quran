And We revealed to Musa, as his people asked him for water, (saying), \"Strike with your staff the stone!\" So there squirt forth from it twelve springs; every folk already knew their drinking-place. And We overshadowed them with mists, and We sent down manna and quails upon them: (i.e. the Tribes) \"Eat of whatever good things with which We have provided you.\" And in no way did they do injustice to Us, but to themselves they were doing injustice"
