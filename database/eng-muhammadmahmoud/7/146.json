    "text": "I will soon turn about from My signs (the ones) who wax proud in the earth untruthfully; and in case they see every sign, they do not believe in it; and in case they see the way of right-mindedness, they will not take it to themselves for a way, and in case they see the way of misguidance, they will take it to themselves for a way. That is for that they cried lies to Our signs and were heedless of them"
