    "text": "Mankind was one nation; so, Allah sent forth the Prophets, constant bearers of good tidings and constant warners, and He sent down with them the Book with the Truth, to judge among mankind concerning that in which they differed. And in no way did anyone differ concerning it except the ones to whom it was brought even after the supreme evidences had come to them, being inequitable among themselves; So Allah guided the ones who believed to the Truth, concerning which they differed, by His permission, and Allah guides whomever He decides to a straight Path"
