(i.e. to be paid) Yet in case some of you feel more secure with some others, (Literally: if some of you \"trust\" some \"others\") then let him who is given the deposit pay back his deposit and let him be pious to Allah his Lord. And do not keep back the testimony; and whoever keeps it back, then surely his heart is vicious; and Allah is Ever-Knowing of whatever you do"
