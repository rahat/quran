Do you then believe in some (parts) of the Book and disbelieve in other parts? (Literally: in some parts) So in no way is the recompense of whoever of you performs that (anything) except disgrace in the present (Literally: the lowly (life), i.e., the life of this world) life, and on the Day of the Resurrection they are to be turned back to the strictest torment. And in no way is Allah ever heedless of whatever you do"
