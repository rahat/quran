    "text": "And they closely followed what the Ash-Shayatin (the all-vicious (ones), i.e., the devils) recited over Sulayman's (Soloman's) kingdom. And in no way did Sulayman (Solomon) disbelieve but Ash- Shayatin (The all-vicious (ones), i.e., the devils) disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery, and that which was sent down upon the two Angels in Babil, (Babylon) Harut and Marut; and in no way did they teach anyone till they said, \"Surely we are only a temptation, so, do not disbelieve.\" Then from them (The two angels) they learned that by which they could cause separation between a person and his spouse. And in no way are they harming anyone except by the permission of Allah ; and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them. And indeed they already knew that indeed whoever trades it, in no way should he have any apportioning (of Grace) in the Hereafter; and miserable indeed was (that) for which they bartered themselves, if they had known (the Truth)"
