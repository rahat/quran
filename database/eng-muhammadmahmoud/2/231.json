    "text": "And when you have divorced women, (and) so they have reached their term, (i.e., cIddah, the term during which a divorced woman may not remarry) then retain them with you with beneficence or release them with beneficence; and do not retain them to their injury so that you transgress. (i.e., by obliging them to relinquish part or all of their dower to you) And whoever performs that, then he has already done injustice to himself; And do not take to yourselves the signs of Allah in mockery (among yourselves); and remember the favor of Allah upon you, and whatever He has sent down on you of the Book and (the) Wisdom to admonish you. And be pious to Allah, and know that Allah is Ever-Knowing of everything"
