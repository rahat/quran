The following verb is in the feminine plural) shall await by themselves for four months and ten (days); (This is the Iddah \"term\" for a widowed woman before she can remarry) so, when they have reached their term, then there is no fault in you whatever they perform (with) themselves with beneficence; and Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
