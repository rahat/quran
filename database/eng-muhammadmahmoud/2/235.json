    "text": "And there is no fault in you concerning whatever offer of betrothal you intimate to women, or nestle in yourselves. Allah knows that you will remember them. But do not make any promise with them secretly, excepting that you say some beneficent saying. And do not resolve on the knot (i.e., the bond) of marriage until the term (Literally: book) has been reached; its term; and know that Allah knows whatever is in yourselves, so be wary of Him. And know that Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Forbearing"
