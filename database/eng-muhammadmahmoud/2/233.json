    "text": "And (women) giving birth, shall suckle their children two rounds completely, (i.e. two years) for the one who is willing to perfect the suckling. And it is for the man to whom children are born to offer them provision and raiment with beneficence. No self is charged except to its capacity. No woman giving birth shall be harmed on account of her child, nor shall a man to whom a child is born (be harmed) on account of his child; and the heir (is charged) in like manner. (Literally: like that) So, in case both of them are willing by mutual consent and consultation to wean, then there is no fault in them (both). And in case you are willing to seek suckling for your children, then there is no fault in you when you hand over whatever you have brought (them) with beneficence; and be pious to Allah and know that Allah is Ever-Beholding of whatever you do"
