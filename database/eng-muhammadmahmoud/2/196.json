So whoever of you is sick or is hurt in his head, then (make) a ransom by fast or donation, or ritual (sacrifice). Yet, when you are secure, so whoever enjoys the Visitation until the Pilgrimage, then (make) whatever is easiest of offering. Yet, whoever does not find (any offering), then (make) a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage, and seven when you return, that is ten completely; that is for him whose family are not present (i.e. those who do not live in the vicinity of Makkah) at the Inviolable Mosque; and be pious to Allah, and know that Allah is strict in punishment"
