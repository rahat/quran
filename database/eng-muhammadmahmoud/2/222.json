    "text": "And they ask you concerning menstruation. Say, \"It is hurt; so keep apart from women during menstruation, and do not draw near them till they are pure. So, when they have purified themselves, then come up to them (i.e., to have sexual intercourse) from where Allah has commanded you.\" Surely Allah loves the ones constantly repenting, and He loves the ones constantly purifying themselves"
