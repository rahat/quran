    "text": "Surely Allah does not shy from striking a likeness even of a gnat, or anything above it. So for the ones who have believed, (then) they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, and as for the ones who have disbelieved, then they say, \"What is it that Allah would (teach) by this for a similitude?\"Thereby He leads many into error, and thereby He guides many; and thereby in no way does He lead into error anyone except the immoral. (The ungodly, the depraved)"
