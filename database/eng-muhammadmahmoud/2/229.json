And it is not lawful for you to take anything of whatever you have brought (the women) except (in case) they both fear that they may not keep within (Literally: Keep up) the bounds of Allah. So, in case you fear that they may not keep within (Literally: Keep up) the bounds of Allah, it is no fault in them (both) for her to ransom herself. Those are the bounds of Allah; so, do not transgress them; and whoever transgresses the bounds of Allah then those are they (who are) the unjust"
