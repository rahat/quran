    "text": "It is made lawful to you, upon the night of the Fast, to lie (Literally: lying) with your wives; they are a garment (i.e. vestment, mutual protection) for you, and you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you have been betraying yourselves, so He has relented toward you and has been clement to you. So now go in to them, and seek whatever Allah has prescribed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread becomes evident to you from the black thread at dawn; thereafter complete (Literally: perfect) the Fast to the night, and do not go in to them while you are consecrating yourselves in the mosques. Such are the bounds of Allah, so do not draw near them. Thus Allah makes His signs evident to mankind, that possibly they would be pious"
