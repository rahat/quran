    "text": "The ones who eat (up) riba (Interest or other unlawful gain; usury) will not rise up except as he whom Ash-shaytan (The all-vicious, i.e., the Devil) ever smites with the touch rises up. That is because they have said, \"Surely selling is only like rib'a.\" And Allah has made selling lawful, and has prohibited riba.\" So, he to whom an admonition has come from his Lord (and) so has refrained (in obedience), then he will have whatever is bygone, (i.e. he is forgiven for his parts gains) and his case (Literally: command, i.e. the command of Allah to him) is for Allah; and whoever goes back, then those are the companions (i.e., the inhabitants) of the Fire, and they are therein eternally (abiding)"
