And remind with it (i.e., with the true religion ( Islam) so that a self should not be discomfited for what it has earned. Apart from Allah, it has no patron or intercessor. And in case it has (performed) all (acts) of justice, (Literally: if it does Justice with all Justice) it will not be taken from it. Those are they who are discomfited for what they have earned; they will have a drink of scalding (water) and a painful torment for what they used to disbelieve"
