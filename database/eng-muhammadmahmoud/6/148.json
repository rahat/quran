    "text": "The ones who have associated (i.e., associated others with Allah) will soon say, \"If Allah had (so) decided, in no way would we have associated (with Him), nor our fathers, nor would we have even prohibited anything.\" Thus, the ones before them cried lies until they tasted Our violence. Say, \"Do you have in your presence any knowledge so you can bring it out to us? Decidedly you closely follow (nothing) except surmise, and decidedly you (do nothing) except conjecture"
