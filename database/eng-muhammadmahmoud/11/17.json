    "text": "So, is he who (depends) upon a Supreme evidence from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it (equal to a disbeliever)? And even before him is the Book of Musa (Moses) for a leader (i.e., Literally:Iman = guide) and a mercy? Those believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it from (among) the parties, then the Fire is his promised (reward). So do not be (engaged in) wrangling about it; surely it is the Truth from your Lord, but most of mankind do not believe"
