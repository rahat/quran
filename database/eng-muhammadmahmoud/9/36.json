    "text": "Surely the (right) (i.e. fixed) number of the months in the Providence of Allah is twelve months (ordained) in the Book of Allah the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are prohibiting. (i.e., fighting is prohibited during them) That is the most upright religion. So do not do (any) injustice to yourselves during them; (i.e., durimg the prohibited during them) and fight the associators as a whole as they fight you as a whole; and know that Allah is with the pious"
