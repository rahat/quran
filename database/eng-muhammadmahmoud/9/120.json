    "text": "In no way should the population of Al-Madinah and the Arabs (of the desert) around them stay behind the Messenger of Allah or desirously care more for themselves than for him (Literally: care more for their selves than for his self ; i.e., prefer their lives to his life). That is for that they are afflicted neither by thirst, nor toil, nor scantiness in the way of Allah, nor do they tread any tread enraging the steadfast disbelievers nor attain from an enemy any attainment, except that a righteous deed is thereby written for them (i.e., written to their account) Surely Allah does not waste the reward of the fair-doers"
