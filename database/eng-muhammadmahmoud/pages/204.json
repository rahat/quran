It is a promise, truly (binding) on Him in the Tawrah, and the Injil, and the Qur'an; and who fulfils his covenant (better) than Allah! So feel glad of the tidings of the selling you have made (Literally: allegiance you have sworn) with Him; and that is the (bargain) (that is) the magnificent triumph"
