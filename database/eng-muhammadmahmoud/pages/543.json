In no way can there be a private conference among three (persons), except that He is the fourth of them, nor five (persons), except that He is the sixth of them, nor lesser than that, nor more except that He is with them, wherever they may be; thereafter He will fully inform them of whatever they have done, on the Day of the Resurrection. Surely Allah is Ever-Knowing of everything"

Thereafter they go back to what they were forbidden, and they confer privately together in vice and hostility, and in disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to you, (The Prophet) they greet you with a greeting Allah has not greeted you with; and they say within themselves, \"Had (your warning been true Allah would torment us for what we say!\" Enough reckoning for them will be Hell, at which they will be to roast.
