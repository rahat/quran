And indeed Our Messengers have already come to them with supreme evidences; thereafter surely many of them after that are indeed extravagant in the earth"

That is a disgrace for them in the present (life), (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and in the Hereafter they will have a tremendous torment"
