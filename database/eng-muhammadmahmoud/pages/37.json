(i.e., by obliging them to relinquish part or all of their dower to you) And whoever performs that, then he has already done injustice to himself; And do not take to yourselves the signs of Allah in mockery (among yourselves); and remember the favor of Allah upon you, and whatever He has sent down on you of the Book and (the) Wisdom to admonish you. And be pious to Allah, and know that Allah is Ever-Knowing of everything"

And it is for the man to whom children are born to offer them provision and raiment with beneficence. No self is charged except to its capacity. No woman giving birth shall be harmed on account of her child, nor shall a man to whom a child is born (be harmed) on account of his child; and the heir (is charged) in like manner. (Literally: like that) So, in case both of them are willing by mutual consent and consultation to wean, then there is no fault in them (both). And in case you are willing to seek suckling for your children, then there is no fault in you when you hand over whatever you have brought (them) with beneficence; and be pious to Allah and know that Allah is Ever-Beholding of whatever you do"
