That is for that they are afflicted neither by thirst, nor toil, nor scantiness in the way of Allah, nor do they tread any tread enraging the steadfast disbelievers nor attain from an enemy any attainment, except that a righteous deed is thereby written for them (i.e., written to their account) Surely Allah does not waste the reward of the fair-doers"
