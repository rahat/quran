            "text": "Surely your Lord knows that you (rise) up (for prayer) nearly two thirds of the night, and (sometimes) a half of it, and (sometimes) a third of it, and a section of the ones with you (also rise for prayer); and Allah determines (precisely) the night and the daytime. He knows that you (The believers, This and the following pronouns are plural) will never enumerate it; so He has relented towards you. Then read of the Qur'an that which is easy (for you). He knows that (some) of you are sick, and others striking in the earth, (i.e., traveling) seeking a share of the Grace of Allah, and others fighting in the way of Allah. So read of it that which is easy (for you). And keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat, and lend to Allah a fair loan. And whatever charity you will forward to your selves, you will find (it) in the Providence of Allah; it will be more charitable (i.e., better) and more magnificent in reward. And ask the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
