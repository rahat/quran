They say, \"In case you are brought this, then take it, and in case you are not brought it, then beware.\" And whomever Allah wills to (subject to) temptation, then you will never possess for him anything against Allah. Those are (they) whose hearts Allah is not willing to purify; for them is disgrace in the present (life), (Literally: lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and in the Hereafter they will have a tremendous torment"
