And whoever of you turn back from his religion, and so dies and he is a disbeliever, then those are the ones whose deeds have been frustrated in the present (life) (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and the Hereafter; and those are the companions (i.e., inhabitants) of the Fire; they are therein eternally (abiding)"
