    "text": "Thereafter He sent down upon you, even after suffering, secure (reassurance), a drowsiness enveloping a section of you; and a section already (became) anxious, surmising other than the truth about Allah, the surmise (s) of (pagan) ignorance. They say, \"Have we anything to do with the Command?\" Say, \"Surely the Command is entirely to Allah.\" They conceal within themselves what they do not display to you; they say, \"If we had had anything to do with the Command, we would not have been killed here now.\" Say, \"If you had been in your homes, the ones for whom killing was prescribed would indeed have gone forth to their recumbencies.\" And that (is so that) Allah might try whatever was in your breasts, and that He might prove whatever is in your hearts; and Allah is Ever-Knowing of whatever is within the breasts (Literally: what the breasts own)"
