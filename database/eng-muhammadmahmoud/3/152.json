    "text": "And indeed Allah has already sincerely (made good) His promise (Literally: was truly sincere in His promise) to you as you overwhelmed them by His permission until you were disheartened and contended together about the Command (i.e. the Command of Allah) and disobeyed (i.e. disobeyed the Messenger) even after He had shown you what you love (The reference is to the Battle of 'Uhud when the archers deserted their posts to share in the spoils). Some of you (there were) who would have the present (life) (Literally: the lowly (life), i.e., life of this world) and some of you (there were) who would have the Hereafter. Thereafter He has made you turn about away from them, that he may try you. And He has already been clement towards you; and Allah is The Owner of Grace upon the believers"
