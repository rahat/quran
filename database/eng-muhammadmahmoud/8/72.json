    "text": "Surely the ones who have believed and have emigrated and striven with their riches and their selves in the way of Allah, and the ones who have given abode and have vindicated, those are constant patrons of one another (Literally: some of them are patrons of some \"others). And the ones who have believed, and have not emigrated, in no way are you to offer them patronage in anything till they emigrate; and in case they ask you (help towards) victory in (the name) of the religion, then you have (to help them) towards victory, except against a people between whom and you there is a compact; and Allah is Ever-Beholding whatever you do"
