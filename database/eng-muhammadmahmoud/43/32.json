We have divided among them their subsistence in the present life (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) and raised some of them above (some) others in degrees, that some of them may take to themselves (some) others in subjection; and the mercy of your Lord is more charitable (i.e., better) than whatever they heap (Literally: gather) together"
