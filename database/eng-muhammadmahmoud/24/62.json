    "text": "Surely they only are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and who, when they are with him upon a common Command, do not go away until they ask his permission. Surely the ones who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for some affair of their own, then give permission to whom you decide of them, and ask for them the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
