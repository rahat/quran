    "text": "Have you not seen that Allah wafts clouds, thereafter joins them together, thereafter makes them accumulated, then you see the raindrops coming out of the midst of them? And He keeps sending down from the heaven mountains, wherein is hail. So He afflicts with it whomever He decides and turns it about from whomever He decides. The splendor of His lightning almost goes away with (i.e., takes away) the beholdings (i.e., eyesights)"
