    "text": "He sends down from the heaven water so that valleys flow, each to its determined (course), so that the flood carries away (on its surface) a swelling scum. And from that on which they kindle fire (i.e., or) seeking (to make) ornaments or belongings, out of that there is a scum like it. Thus Allah strikes the Truth and the untruth. So, as for the scum, then it goes away as jetsam (i.e., vanishes as useless) and as for whatever profits mankind, then it stays in the earth. Thus Allah strikes the similitudes"
