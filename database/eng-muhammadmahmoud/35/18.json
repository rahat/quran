    "text": "And no encumbered self can be encumbered with the encumbrance of (i.e. bear the burden of) another (self). And in case a heavy-burdened (self) calls for its burden (to be carried), not a thing of it will be carried, though he be a near kinsman. Surely you warn only (the ones) who are apprehensive of their Lord in the Unseen and keep up the prayer. And whoever cleanses himself, then he cleanses it for himself. (i.e., for his own benefit) And to Allah is the Destiny"
