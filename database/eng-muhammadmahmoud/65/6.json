    "text": "Make them dwell (in some part of the housing) where you are dwelling, according to your means, and do not try to hurt them, so as to straiten (their circumstances). And in case they are with burden, (i.e., pregnant) then expend upon them until they bring forth their burden. So in case they suckle for you, then bring them their rewards, and deliberate among yourselves beneficently; and in case you (both) encounter) difficulties, then another (woman shall suckle for him)"
