Then if God grant you a victory, they say, \"Are we not with you?\" and if the infidels meet with a success, they say to them, \"Were we not superior to you: and did we not defend you from those believers?\" God shall judge betwixt ye on the day of the resurrection, and God will by no means make a way for the infidels over the believers"
