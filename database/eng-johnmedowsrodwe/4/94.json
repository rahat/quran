    "text": "O believers! when ye go forth to the fight for the cause of God, be discerning, and say not to every one who meeteth you with a greeting, \"Thou art not a believer\" in your greed after the chance good things of this present life! With God are abundant spoils. Such hath been your wont in times past; but god hath been gracious to you. Be discerning, then, for God well knoweth what ye do"
