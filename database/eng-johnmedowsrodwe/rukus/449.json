Thou mayst see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, imploring favours from God, and His acceptance. Their tokens are on their faces, the marks of their prostrations. This is their picture in the Law, and their picture in the Evangel: they are as the seed which putteth forth its stalk; then strengtheneth it, and it groweth stout, and riseth upon its stem, rejoicing the husbandman - that the infidels may be wrathful at them. To such of them as believe and do the things that are right, hath God promised forgiveness and a noble recompense"
