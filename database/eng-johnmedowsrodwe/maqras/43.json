Woe this day on those who forsake your religion! And fear them not, but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have filled up the measure of my favours upon you: and it is my pleasure that Islam be your religion; but whoso without wilful leanings to wrong shall be forced by hunger to transgress, to him, verily, will God be Indulgent, Merciful"
