Slumber fell upon a part of you: as to the other part - their own passions stirred them up to think unjustly of God with thoughts of ignorance! They said - What gain we by this affair? SAY: Verily the affair resteth wholly with God. They hid in their minds what they did not speak out to thee, saying, \"Were we to have gained aught in this affair, none of us had been slain at this place.\" SAY: Had ye remained in your homes, they who were decreed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they lie: - in order that God might make trial of what was in your breasts, and might discover what was in your hearts, for God knoweth the very secrets of the breast"
