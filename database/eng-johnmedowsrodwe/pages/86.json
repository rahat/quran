Hear thou, but as one that heareth not; and LOOK AT US;\" perplexing with their tongues, and wounding the Faith by their revilings. But if they would say, \"We have heard, and we obey; hear thou, and REGARD US;\" it were better for them, and more right. But God hath cursed them for their unbelief. Few only of them are believers"
