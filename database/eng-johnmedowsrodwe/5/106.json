    "text": "O believers! let there be witnesses between you, when death draweth nigh to any of you, at the time of making the testament; two witnesses - just men from among yourselves, or two others of a different tribe from yourselves - if ye be journeying in the earth, and the calamity of death surprise you. Ye shall shut them both up, after the prayer; and if ye doubt them, they shall swear by God, \"We will not take a bribe though the party be of kin to us, neither will we conceal the testimony of God, for then we should be among the wicked"
