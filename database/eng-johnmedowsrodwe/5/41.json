    "text": "O Apostle! let not those who vie with one another in speeding to infidelity vex thee; - of those who say with their mouths, \"We believe,\" but whose hearts believe not; - or of the Jews listeners to a lie-listeners to others - but who come not to thee. They shift the words of the law from their places, and say, \"If this be brought to you, receive it; but if this be not brought to you, then beware of it.\" For him whom God would mislead, thou canst in no wise prevail with God! They whose hearts God shall not please to cleanse, shall suffer disgrace in this world, and in the next a grievous punishment"
