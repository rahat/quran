    "text": "O Believers! violate neither the rites of God, nor the sacred month Muharram, nor the offering, nor its ornaments, nor those who press on to the sacred house seeking favour from their Lord and his good pleasure in them. But when all is over, then take to the chase: and let not ill will at those who would have kept you from the sacred mosque lead you to transgress, but rather be helpful to one another according to goodness and piety, but be not helpful for evil and malice: and fear ye God. Verily, God is severe in punishing"
