    "text": "He it is who caused the unbelievers among the people of the Book to quit their homes and join those who had EMIGRATED previously. Ye did not think that they would quit them; and they on their part thought that their fortresses would protect them against God: But God came upon them whence they looked not for Him, and cast such fear into their hearts that by their own hands as well as by the hands of the victorious believers they demolished their houses! Profit by this example ye who are men of insight"
