SAY: The knowledge of it is only with my Lord: none shall manifest it in its time but He: it is the burden of the Heavens and of the Earth: not otherwise than on a sudden will it come on you. They will ask thee as if thou wast privy to it: SAY: The knowledge of it is with none but God. But most men know not this"
