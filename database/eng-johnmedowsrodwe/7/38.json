So oft as a fresh generation entereth, it shall curse its sister, until when they have all reached it, the last comers shall say to the former, 'O our Lord! these are they who led us astray: assign them therefore a double torment of the fire:\"' He will say, \"Ye shall all have double.\" But of this are ye ignorant"
