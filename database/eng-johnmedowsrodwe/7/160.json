    "text": "And we divided the Israelites into twelve tribes, as nations; and we revealed unto Moses when the people asked drink of him - \"Strike the rock with thy staff:\" and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains - the men all knew their drinking places. And we caused clouds to overshadow them, and sent down upon them the manna and the quails. . . . \"Eat of the good things with which we have supplied you.\" But it was not us whom they injured, but they injured their own selves"
