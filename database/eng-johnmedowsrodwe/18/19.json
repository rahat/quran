Said one of them, \"How long have ye tarried here?\" They said, \"We have tarried a day or part of day.\" They said, \"Your Lord knoweth best how long ye have tarried: Send now one of you with this your coin into the city, and let him mark who therein hath purest food, and from him let him bring you a supply: and let him be courteous, and not discover you to any one"
