    "text": "O ye who believe! let your slaves, and those of you who have not come of age, ask leave of you, three times a day, ere they come into your presence; - before the morning prayer, and when ye lay aside your garments at mid-day, and after the evening prayer. These are your three times of privacy. No blame shall attach to you or to them, if after these times, when ye go your rounds of attendance on one another, they come in without permission. Thus doth God make clear to you His signs: and God is Knowing, Wise"
