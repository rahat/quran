    "text": "And, remember, when thou saidst to him unto whom God had shewn favour, and to whom thou also hadst shewn favour, \"Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God;\" and thou didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light. and thou didst fear man; but more right had it been to fear God. And when Zaid had settled concerning her to divorce her, we married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they have settled the affair concerning them. And the behest of God is to be performed"
