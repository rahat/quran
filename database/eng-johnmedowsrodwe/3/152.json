    "text": "Already had God made good to you His promise, when by His permission ye destroyed your foes, until your courage failed you, and ye disputed about the order, and disobeyed, after that the Prophet had brought you within view of that for which ye longed. Some of you were for this world, and some for the next. Then, in order to make trial of you, He turned you to flight from them, - yet hath He now forgiven you; for all-bounteous is God to the faithful"
