    "text": "He it is who hath sent down to thee \"the Book.\" Some of its signs are of themselves perspicuous; - these are the basis of the Book - and others are figurative. But they whose hearts are given to err, follow its figures, craving discord, craving an interpretation; yet none knoweth its interpretation but God. And the stable in knowledge say, \"We believe in it: it is all from our Lord.\" But none will bear this in mind, save men endued with understanding"
