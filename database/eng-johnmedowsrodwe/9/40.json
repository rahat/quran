God assisted him formerly, when the unbelievers drove him forth, in company with a second only! when they two were in the cave; when the Prophet said to his companion, \"Be not distressed; verily, God is with us.\" And God sent down His tranquillity upon him, and strengthened him with hosts ye saw not, and made the word of those who believed not the abased, and the word of God was the exalted: for God is Mighty, Wise"
