    "text": "Indeed those who believed and migrated and tried hard with their possessions and their lives in God's way, and those who placed and helped (them), some of them are supporters (and friends) of the others. And those who believed and did not migrate, there is nothing upon you for their protection until they migrate. But if they ask for your help in the religion, then the help is your responsibility, except against a group that there is an agreement between you and them. God sees what you do"
