    "text": "You do not find any group who believe in God and the last day that they love those who oppose God and His messenger, even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their family (and tribe members). He wrote the belief in their hearts and He assisted them with a spirit from Him, and He admits them to gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, they are God's party. Know that God's party, they are indeed the successful ones"
