    "text": "Did you not see that God knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is on the earth? There is not any whispering of three unless He is the fourth of them, and not of any five unless He is the sixth of them, and no less or no more than this unless He is with them, wherever they are. Then on the resurrection day He informs them of what they did. Indeed God knows everything"
