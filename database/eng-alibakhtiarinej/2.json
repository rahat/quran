Then God made him die for one hundred years, then He raised him (and brought him back to life) and said: how long did you remain (dead)? He said: I remained a day or part of a day. He said: no, you remained for one hundred years, so look at your food and drink, it did not age (or spoil), and look at your donkey (that is turned to bones), and We make you a sign (of resurrection) for the people, and look at the bones (of your donkey) how We put them back together and We cover it with flesh. So when it was clear to him, he said: I know that God is capable of everything"
