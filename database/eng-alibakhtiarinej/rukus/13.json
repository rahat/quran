But they did not harm anyone with it except by God’s permission. And they learn things that harm them and have no benefit for them. And they certainly knew that whoever buys it (witchcraft) there will be no share for him in the hereafter. And what they sold themselves to it is definitely bad, if they knew (the truth)"
