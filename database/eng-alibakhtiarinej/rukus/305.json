Example of His light is like a lamp holder with a lamp in it, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as if it is a brilliant star lit by (the oil of) a blessed olive tree, that is not facing east or west, and its oil almost glows (by itself) even though fire did not touch it. Light upon light, God guides whom He wants to His light. And God gives the examples for the people, and God knows everything"
