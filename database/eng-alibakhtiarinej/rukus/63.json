And for the parents, for each one of them is one sixth of what is left if he has a child, and if he does not have a child and his inheritors are (only) his parents then one third is for the mother (and the rest is for the father), and if there are siblings for him then one sixth is for the mother, after fulfilling any will he instructed it or paying off any debt. You do not know whether your parents or your children have more benefits for you. This is a mandate from God. God is knowledgeable and wise"

And one quarter of what you leave is for them if you don't have a child, and if you have a child then one eighth of what you leave is for them, after fulfilling the will that you instructed to it or paying off any debt. And if a man or a woman who is to be inherited from has no direct heir and he has a brother or a sister, for each one of them is one sixth, and if more than two, then they all share in a third, after fulfilling the will that he instructed to it and paying off any debt without causing any loss.
