So they all drank from it except a few of them. Then when he and those who believed with him crossed it (the river), they said: we do not have the strength to face Goliath and his troops today. Those who thought that they meet God said: many small forces overcame large forces by God’s permission, and God is with the patient ones (and those who persevere)"
