When you are allowed (after the Hajj) then you may hunt. And the hatred of those who prevented you from the Sacred Mosque should not make you misbehave so that you exceed the limits. And cooperate based on the goodness and self control and do not cooperate based on the sin and enmity, and be cautious of God, as God is severe in punishment"

These are disobedience. Today those who disbelieved lost hope about your religion (way of life), so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I completed your religion for you and I finished my favor upon you and I chose the submission (Islam) as a religion for you. If anyone is forced by hunger, not intentionally committing a sin, then God is forgiving and merciful"
