    "text": "Prophet, when you divorce the women, then divorce them after their waiting period (three monthly periods) and keep count of the waiting period and be cautious of God your Master. (During that period) do not drive them out of their houses and they should not leave unless they commit an obvious indecency. This is limits set by God. And anyone who exceeds limits set by God then he has wronged himself. You do not know, for God may bring about an affair after that (to cause reconciliation)"
