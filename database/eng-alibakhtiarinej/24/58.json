    "text": "You who believe, those whom your right hands own and those (children) among you who have not reached puberty should ask your permission at three times (before coming to your room). Before morning mandatory prayer, and when you put off your clothes during noon time, and after evening mandatory prayer. (These are) three times of privacy for you. There is no blame on you or on them to circulate around you and each other at other times. That is how God clarifies the signs for you, and God is knowledgeable and wise"
