    "text": "And those who do not find (any way) to marry, should abstain (from sex) until God enriches them from His bounty. And those among what your right hands own who ask for the certificate (of freedom), then write it for them if you know any good in them, and give them some of God’s possession that He gave you. And do not force your maids into prostitution looking for gain of this world’s life, if they want to be chaste. And if anyone forces them, then after their compulsion God is forgiving and merciful (to them)"
