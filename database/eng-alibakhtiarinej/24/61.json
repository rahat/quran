    "text": "There is no blame on the blind and no blame on the lame (crippled) and no blame on the sick and not on yourselves if you eat in your houses or your fathers’ houses or your mothers’ houses or your brothers’ houses or your sisters’ houses or your fathers’ brothers’ houses or your fathers’ sisters’ houses or your mothers’ brothers’ houses or your mother's sisters’ houses or the houses that you have their keys or your friend’s houses. There is no blame on you if you eat together or separately. So when you enter any houses then greet each other, a blessed and pure greeting from God. That is how God clarifies the signs for you that you may understand"
