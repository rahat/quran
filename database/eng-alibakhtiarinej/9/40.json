    "text": "If you do not help him, God has helped him when those who disbelieved drove him out (of Mecca), he was one of two when they were in the cave, and he said to his friend: do not be sad, God is indeed with us. So God sent down His tranquility to him and strengthened him with troops that you do not see them, and He made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest and Godâ€™s word the highest. God is the powerful and the wise"
