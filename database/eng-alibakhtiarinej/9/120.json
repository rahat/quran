    "text": "It is not (appropriate) for the people of the city (Medina) and those around them among the desert Arabs to stay behind (and refuse to follow) the messenger of God, and prefer their lives to his life. That is because they do not suffer any thirst or difficulty or hunger in God's way, or any step they take to anger the disbelievers or any gain they gain against an enemy unless it is written down for them as good work. God does not waste reward of the good doers"
