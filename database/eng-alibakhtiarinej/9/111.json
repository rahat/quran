    "text": "Indeed God purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions for the garden that is for them. They fight in God's way, and they kill and are killed. This is a true promise upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran. And who fulfills his promise better than God? So, be glad with your trade that you bargained with it, that is the great victory"
