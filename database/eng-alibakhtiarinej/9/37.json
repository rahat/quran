    "text": "Postponement (of the sacred months) is only an increase in the disbelief, which those who disbelieved are misguided by it. They make it lawful one year and forbid it another year, to make up the number that God made sacred, therefore they make lawful what God made unlawful. Their bad deeds are beautified for them, and God does not guide the disbelieving people"
