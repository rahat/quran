    "text": "They swear by God that they did not say, while they have certainly said the word of the disbelief, and they disbelieved after their submission, and they tried for what they did not get. They were only resentful because God and His messenger enriched them from His grace. So if they repent, it would better for them, and if they turn away, God punishes them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter, and there is no protector or helper for them on the earth"
