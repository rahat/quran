    "text": "Prophet, We made lawful for you, your wives that you gave them their compensations (marriage portions), and those whom your right hand owns (slaves) from what God gave you as spoil, and daughters of your paternal uncle (your father’s brother), and daughters of your paternal aunts (your father’s sister), and daughters of your maternal uncles (your mother’s brother), and daughters of your maternal aunts (your mother’s sister) who migrated with you, and a believing woman who gives herself to the prophet (without asking for marriage portion) if the prophet wants to marry her, this (last group) is only for you and not the other believers. We also know what We mandated to them (the believers) regarding their wives and those whom their right hands own, so that there would be no difficulty (or blame) on you. And God is forgiving and merciful"
