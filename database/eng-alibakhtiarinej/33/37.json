    "text": "And (remember) when you said to the one whom God favored upon him and you favored upon him: keep your wife for yourself, and be cautious of God. And you hid in yourself what God was to disclose it. And you feared people, while God is more deserving that you fear Him. So when Zaid finished with her (and divorced her), We married her to you so that there would be no difficulty for the believers about (marrying) wives of their adopted sons when they are finished with them (and have divorced them). And Godâ€™s command is to be done"
