    "text": "If it was a Quran that the mountains was moved by it or the earth was torn into pieces by it or the dead were made to speak by it (they would still not believe in it). No, but all the affairs belong to God. Did not those who believed give up hope (and realized) that if God wants He would guide all the people? And those who disbelieved, catastrophe does not stop to happen to them or to fall near their homes because of what they did, until Godâ€™s promise comes. Indeed God does not break His promise"
