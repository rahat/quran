    "text": "He sent down rain from the sky and it flowed in the valleys according to their measure, then the current carried the foam that built up (on its surface). And similar foam (builds up) from what they melt in the fire to make ornaments or utensils. That is how God gives example of the truth and the falsehood. As for the foam, it goes away uselessly, but that which benefits the people stays on the earth. This is how God gives the examples"
