    "text": "After the sadness, He sent down to you a peaceful nap overcoming a group of you while a group were worried about their lives, unjustifiably thinking about God like the thoughts of the ignorance, saying: is any part of the matter up to us? Say: indeed all the matters are up to God. They hide in themselves what they do not reveal to you, they say: if anything about the matter was up to us, we would not be killed here. Say: even if you stayed in your houses, those whom the death was written for them would come out to the place of their death. And God tests what is in your minds to purify what is in your hearts. God knows what is inside the minds"
