    "text": "The believers shall not take disbelievers as their supporters (and protectors) in lieu of the believers. And whoever does this, then he is not on anything from God (and has nothing to do with Him), unless you cautiously protect yourself from them. And God warns you about Himself (and His punishment). And the final return is to God"
