    "text": "You who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and they said about their brothers when they travelled on the earth or were in a war: if they were with us, they would not have died and would not have been killed. So that God makes that a (source) of regret in their hearts. God gives life and causes death. And God sees what you do"
