    "text": "You who believe, do not dismiss God's rituals or the prohibited month or the offering (of sacrifice) or the collared offering or those going to the sacred house (Ka’aba) looking for their Master’s grace and pleasure. When you are allowed (after the Hajj) then you may hunt. And the hatred of those who prevented you from the Sacred Mosque should not make you misbehave so that you exceed the limits. And cooperate based on the goodness and self control and do not cooperate based on the sin and enmity, and be cautious of God, as God is severe in punishment"
