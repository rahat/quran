    "text": "God does not hold you responsible for your useless oaths, but He holds you responsible for your binding oaths. Then its penalty is to feed ten needy with the average of what you feed your family or to clothe them or to free a slave, and anyone who did not find then he should fast for three days. This is penalty of your oaths that you swore. And keep your oaths. That is how God clarifies His signs for you so you may be thankful"
