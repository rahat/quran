    "text": "And We sent down the book to you in truth, confirming what was before it from the book and safeguarding over it, so judge between them by what God sent down and do not follow their desires, away from that which came to you of the truth. For each of you We made statute and procedure, and if God wanted, He would have made you a single community, but He shall test you with what He gave you, so compete in the good. You all return to God, then He informs you about what you used to disagree about it"
