    "text": "Today the good things are made lawful for you, and food of those who were given the book is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them, and the chaste among the believing women and the chaste among those who were given the book before you (are lawful) when you pay their compensations (marriage portions) for marriage and not for fornication (or prostitution) and not taking them as lovers. Whoever rejects the belief, indeed his work becomes useless and he is among the losers in the hereafter"
