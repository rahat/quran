    "text": "And the Jewish said: Godâ€™s hand is tied. Their hands are tied and they are cursed for what they said. But His hands are wide open, He spends as He wants. And what was sent down to you from your Master shall increase rebellion and disbelief of many of them. And We placed the animosity and the hatred between them until the resurrection day. Every time they ignite a fire for the war, God extinguishes it, and they spread corruption on the earth, whereas God does not like the corruptors"
