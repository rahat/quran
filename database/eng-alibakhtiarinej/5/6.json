    "text": "You who believe, when you intend to perform the mandatory prayer, wash you faces and your hands to the elbows and wipe your head and (wipe/wash) your feet to the ankles, and if you had orgasm, then clean yourself, and if you were sick or on a journey, or one of you came from toilet, or you had (sexual) contact with a woman and could not find water then perform dry ablution using clean soil (or stone) rubbing your faces and hands with it. God does not want to make it difficult for you, but He wants to make you clean and to finish His favor upon you, so you may be thankful"
