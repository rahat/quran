    "text": "You who believe, when the death gets to any of you, take two witnesses from just persons among yourself during making of the will, or from other than yourselves if you are traveling in the land and the tragedy of death hits you. If you have doubt, hold them after the mandatory prayer so they swear by God that: we will not sell it for any price even if it is for our relatives (or close ones), and we will not hide Godâ€™s testimony, in that case we will be among the sinners"
