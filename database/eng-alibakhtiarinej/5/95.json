    "text": "You who believe, do not kill the game (in hunting) while you are forbidden (during the Hajj). Anyone of you who kills it intentionally, then his punishment is the livestock like what he killed, as judged by two just persons among you, as an offering to reach the Ka'aba, or penalty of feeding some needy or the equivalent of that in fasting, so he may taste the consequence of his action. God excuses what is passed, and anyone who returns (to such actions) then God revenges from him, and God is powerful and revengeful"
