    "text": "The dead, and the blood, and the meet of the pig, and what is offered up for (sacrificed for) other than God, and the strangled, and the beaten to death, and the dead because of a fall, and the dead by being gored, and what the wild animal ate except what you slaughtered (before it dies), and what is sacrificed on the stones (altars of idols), and what is divided by the lottery arrows are forbidden to you. These are disobedience. Today those who disbelieved lost hope about your religion (way of life), so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I completed your religion for you and I finished my favor upon you and I chose the submission (Islam) as a religion for you. If anyone is forced by hunger, not intentionally committing a sin, then God is forgiving and merciful"
