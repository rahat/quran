    "text": "Messenger, do not be sad by those who race to the disbelief among those who said we believe with their lips but their hearts did not believe. And some of those who are Jewish listen to the lies, listening to other people who did not come to you, changing the word from its places (and context) saying: if you are given this then accept it, and if you were not given it then stay away from it. And anyone whom God wants to test him, then you will never have any power for him against God. They are those whom God did not want to cleanse their hearts, there is disgrace for them in this world and a great punishment is for them in the hereafter"
