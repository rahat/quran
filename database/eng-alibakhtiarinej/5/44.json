    "text": "We sent down the Torah, there is light and guidance in it. The prophets, those who submitted (to God), and the devoted ones and the religious scholars judge those who were Jewish with it, because they were made guardians of God's book and they were witnesses to it, so do not fear people but fear Me, and do not sell my signs for a small price. And anyone who does not judge by what God sent down, then they are the disbelievers"
