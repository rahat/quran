    "text": "Know that this world’s life is only play and amusement, and decoration and show off among yourselves, and wanting more in the wealth and the children. It is like the example of a rain that its plant growth impresses the farmers, then it dries up and you see it turn yellow and then becomes broken pieces. And in the hereafter there is severe punishment (for the disbelievers) and forgiveness and pleasure of God (for the believers). And this world’s life is only means of the deception"
