    "text": "God instructs you regarding your children that: for a male is the same portion as two females and if they are all women and more than two, they get two third of what is left, and if she is only one, then she gets half. And for the parents, for each one of them is one sixth of what is left if he has a child, and if he does not have a child and his inheritors are (only) his parents then one third is for the mother (and the rest is for the father), and if there are siblings for him then one sixth is for the mother, after fulfilling any will he instructed it or paying off any debt. You do not know whether your parents or your children have more benefits for you. This is a mandate from God. God is knowledgeable and wise"
