    "text": "And anyone among you who cannot afford to marry the free chaste believing woman, then (marry) from your believing maids among what your right hands own. God best knows your belief, you are from one another. So marry them with permission of their owners (and their families) and give them their compensations (marriage portions) nicely for marriage and not fornication/adultery and not taking them as lovers. And when they are married, if they commit an indecency, then their punishment is half of what is for a free married woman. This is for anyone of you who fears committing fornication, but if you are patient it is better for you. God is forgiving and merciful"
