    "text": "Did you not see those who were told: withhold your hands (and do not fight) and perform the mandatory prayer and give to the mandatory charity, but when fighting was prescribed for them, a group of them feared men as they feared God or even feared more and said: our Master, why did you prescribe fighting for us, why did you not postpone it for a short while? Say: enjoyment of this world is small and the hereafter is best for anyone who controls himself, and you will not be wronged a bit"
