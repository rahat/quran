    "text": "And when you (Muhammad) were among them and you established the mandatory prayer for them, then a group of them should stand with you and should take their arms, then when they prostrated, then they should go behind you and other group that has not prayed should come to pray with you while taking precaution and (carrying) their arms. Those who disbelieved wish that you neglect from your arms and your things so that they attack you, a single (and sudden) attack. And there is no blame on you if you put down your arms if you are annoyed by rain or you are sick, but take precaution. Indeed God prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers"
