    "text": "You who believe, when you travel in God's way, then make it clear (and investigate thoroughly), and do not say to someone who offers you peace (or admits to submission) you are not a believer, looking for the wealth of this life. Whereas there are many spoils with God. That is how you were before, so God favored upon you, so make it clear. God is well aware of what you do"
