    "text": "Those (hypocrites) who wait for you, and if there is a victory for you from God, they say: were we not with you? And if there is a share (of victory) for the disbelievers, they say: did we not have power over you and yet we protected you from the believers. God judges between you on the resurrection day. And God will never make a way for the disbelievers over the believers"
