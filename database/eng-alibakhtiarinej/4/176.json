    "text": "They ask your opinion, say: God gives His opinion to you regarding one with no direct heir. If a man dies having no child but has a sister, then half of what he leaves is hers, while he inherits (everything) from her if she has no child. And if there are two sisters then two third of what he leaves is theirs, and if there are multiple brothers and sisters, then for the male is as much as two females. God explains for you, that you don't make mistake. And God knows everything"
