    "text": "And (forbidden to you are) all married women except what your right hands own, God's prescription for you, and what is beyond that is made lawful for you, that you look for them with your wealth for marriage and not fornication/adultery. So for what you enjoyed from them (consummation of marriage), give them their compensations (marriage portions) as a mandate. And there is no blame on you for what you mutually agree about it after the mandate. Indeed God is knowledgeable and wise"
