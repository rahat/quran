    "text": "You who believe, do not get close to the mandatory prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you say, and not after orgasm until you wash except when you are traveling on the road, and if you are sick or on a journey or one of you comes from toilet or you had (sexual) contact with a woman and could not find water, then perform dry ablution using clean soil (or stone or sand) rubbing it to your faces and hands. God is pardoning and forgiving"
