    "text": "And half of what your wives leave is for you if they don't have a child, and if they have a child then one quarter of what they leave is for you, after fulfilling the will that they instructed to it or paying off any debt. And one quarter of what you leave is for them if you don't have a child, and if you have a child then one eighth of what you leave is for them, after fulfilling the will that you instructed to it or paying off any debt. And if a man or a woman who is to be inherited from has no direct heir and he has a brother or a sister, for each one of them is one sixth, and if more than two, then they all share in a third, after fulfilling the will that he instructed to it and paying off any debt without causing any loss. This is an instruction from God, and God is Knowledgeable and patient"
