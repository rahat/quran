And anyone who kills a believer by a mistake should set a believing slave free and pay full compensation to his family unless they forgive it. And if he was from a group who were your enemy and he was a believer, then setting a believing slave free. And if he was from a group that there is an agreement between you and them, then paying full compensation to his family and setting a believing slave free. And anyone who cannot find (a slave or afford one) then fasting for two consecutive months as repentance from God. God is knowledgeable and wise"
