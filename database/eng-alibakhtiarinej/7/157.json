    "text": "Those who follow the messenger (Muhammad), the illiterate prophet, the one they find him written in the Torah and the Gospel that is with them, he instructs them to what is right and prohibits them from what is wrong, and he makes the good thing lawful for them and prohibits them from the bad things, and he removes their burden and the shackles that is on them from them. So those who believed in him and assisted him and helped him and followed the light (Quran) that was sent with him, they are the successful ones"
