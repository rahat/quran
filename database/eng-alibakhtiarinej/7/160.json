    "text": "And We divided them (children of Israel) into twelve tribes of nations, and We revealed to Moses when his people asked him for water: strike the stone with your cane. Then twelve springs flowed out of it, and all people knew their drinking place, and we shaded over them with the clouds, and We sent down the Manna and the Salwa (two kind of edible foods) to them. Eat from good things that We provided you. And they did not do wrong to Us, but they were wrong to themselves"
