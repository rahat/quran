    "text": "And when Moses came to Our appointment and his Master spoke to him, he said: my Master, show me (yourself) that I look at you. He (God) said: you will never see Me, but look at the mountain and if it stays in its place then you will see Me. So when his Master displayed Himself to the mountain, He pulverized it, and Moses fell unconscious, and when he woke up, he said: You are flawless, I repent to You, and I am the first (or the best) of the believers"
