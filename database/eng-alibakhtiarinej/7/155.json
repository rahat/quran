So when the earthquake took them, he said: my Master, if You wanted, You could have destroyed them and me before this, do You kill us for what the fools among us did, this is only a test from You, misguiding anyone You want with it and guiding anyone You want, You are our protector (and supporter), so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the best of the forgivers"
