    "text": "And leave those who took their way of life as a play and an amusement, and this world's life deceived them. And remind with it that a person is subjected to punishment (or is disgraced) by what it does and it has no protector and no mediator other than God, and if it offers as compensation all compensations, it would not be taken from it. They are those who are subjected to punishment (or are disgraced) for what they did. There is drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for them because of what they used to disbelieve"
