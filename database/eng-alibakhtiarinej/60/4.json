    "text": "There has been a good example for you in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people: we are free of (and have nothing to do with) you and whatever you serve other than God, we disbelieve in you, and an unending enmity and hatred started between us and you until you believe in God alone. Except Abraham's word to his father: I shall ask forgiveness for you, although I donâ€™t have power of anything for you from God. Our Master, we trust in You and we turn to You (in repentance) and the final return is to You"
