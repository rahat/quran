    "text": "You who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy as your friends, offering them friendship. They have disbelieved in what came to you in truth, driving the messenger and yourselves out because you believe in God your Master. If you go out to try hard in My way and look for My pleasure, why do you secretly offer them the friendship, while I know what you hide and what you disclose. And whoever among you does it, he has lost the even way"
