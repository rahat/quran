And We settle what We want in the wombs for a limited period, then We bring you out as a baby, then you reach your full maturity (and strength), and some of you die and some of you are returned to the lowest part of life, so that they do not know anything after knowing (and they forget everything). And you see the earth barren (and lifeless), then when We send down the rain on it, it revives and grows and produces all types of beautiful (plants)"
