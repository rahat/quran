God knew that you betray yourselves, so He turned to you and excused you, so now you may have intercourse with them and look for what God mandated to you. And eat and drink until the white line becomes clear to you from the dark line at dawn, then complete the fast until the nightfall. And do not have intercourse with them while you are in retreat for devotion (worship) into the mosque. That is the limits set by God, so do not go near it. This is how God makes His signs clear to the people, so they may control themselves"
