There is not any whispering of three unless He is the fourth of them, and not of any five unless He is the sixth of them, and no less or no more than this unless He is with them, wherever they are. Then on the resurrection day He informs them of what they did. Indeed God knows everything"

And when they come to you, they greet you in such a way that God has not greeted you with it, and they say among themselves: why does not God punish us for what we say? Hell is enough for them, they enter (and burn in) it, and it is a bad destination"
