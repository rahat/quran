No, but all the affairs belong to God. Did not those who believed give up hope (and realized) that if God wants He would guide all the people? And those who disbelieved, catastrophe does not stop to happen to them or to fall near their homes because of what they did, until God’s promise comes. Indeed God does not break His promise"

No, but for those who disbelieved their plot is beautified and they are kept back from the (right) way. And there is no guide for anyone who God misguides"
