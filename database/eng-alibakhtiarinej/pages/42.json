And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. And if God wanted, those after them would not have fought after the clear proofs came to them, but they disagreed, so some of them believed and some of them disbelieved.

His throne extends over the skies and the earth, and maintaining them does not bother Him. He is the superior, the great"
