Solomon did not disbelieve but the devils disbelieved, teaching people witchcraft and what was sent down to the two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut. But neither of the two teaches anyone before saying: we are only a temptation, do not disbelieve. So they learn from them what causes separation between the man and his wife. But they did not harm anyone with it except by God’s permission. And they learn things that harm them and have no benefit for them. And they certainly knew that whoever buys it (witchcraft) there will be no share for him in the hereafter. And what they sold themselves to it is definitely bad, if they knew (the truth)"
