He (Moses) said: do you want to exchange that which is better with something that is worse? Go down to a city (possibly in Egypt) and you will find what you are asking for. And poverty and misery covered them and they were stricken by God’s anger, because they disbelieved in God’s signs and killed the prophets unjustifiably. This is because they rebelled and violated (the law)"
