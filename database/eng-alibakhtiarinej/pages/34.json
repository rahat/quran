Say: fighting in it is a great (sin), but preventing from God’s way and disbelieving him and (preventing from) the Sacred Mosque and driving out its people from there are greater (sins) in God’s view. Turmoil (and persecution) is worse than murder. They will not stop fighting you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can. And anyone of you who turns back from his religion and die while he is a disbeliever, then their works become useless in this world and the hereafter, and they are inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever"

This is how God makes the signs clear for you, so you may think"
