Jesus Christ, son of Mary, was only a messenger of God, and His word which He conveyed to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say: three (or trinity). Stop, that is better for you. God is the only one god, He is flawless (and beyond) that there is a child for Him. Everything in the skies and in the earth belongs to him, and God is enough as an advocate"
