If a man dies having no child but has a sister, then half of what he leaves is hers, while he inherits (everything) from her if she has no child. And if there are two sisters then two third of what he leaves is theirs, and if there are multiple brothers and sisters, then for the male is as much as two females. God explains for you, that you don't make mistake. And God knows everything"

When you are allowed (after the Hajj) then you may hunt. And the hatred of those who prevented you from the Sacred Mosque should not make you misbehave so that you exceed the limits. And cooperate based on the goodness and self control and do not cooperate based on the sin and enmity, and be cautious of God, as God is severe in punishment"
