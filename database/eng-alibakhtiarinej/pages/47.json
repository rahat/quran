This is because they said that the sale (and doing business) is like the usury, while God permitted the sale and prohibited the usury. So anyone whom an advice from his Master came to him and he stopped, then his past (profits) is his and his case is with God, and anyone who goes back (to usury), then they will be inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever"
