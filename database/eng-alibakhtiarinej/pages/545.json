He wrote the belief in their hearts and He assisted them with a spirit from Him, and He admits them to gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, they are God's party. Know that God's party, they are indeed the successful ones"

And they thought that their fortresses would protect them against God, but God came to them from where they did not expect, and He threw horror in their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the believers' hands. So you who have insight, learn a lesson"
