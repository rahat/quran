These are disobedience. Today those who disbelieved lost hope about your religion (way of life), so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I completed your religion for you and I finished my favor upon you and I chose the submission (Islam) as a religion for you. If anyone is forced by hunger, not intentionally committing a sin, then God is forgiving and merciful"

Say: the good things are made lawful for you, and what you taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) according to what God taught you. So eat from what they catch for you and mention Godâ€™s name on it, and be cautious of God as God is quick in accounting"

Whoever rejects the belief, indeed his work becomes useless and he is among the losers in the hereafter"
