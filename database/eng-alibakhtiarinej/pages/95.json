Those who disbelieved wish that you neglect from your arms and your things so that they attack you, a single (and sudden) attack. And there is no blame on you if you put down your arms if you are annoyed by rain or you are sick, but take precaution. Indeed God prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers"
