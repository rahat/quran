So good women are loyal, looking after what God takes care of in the absence (of their husband). And those whom you are afraid of their disloyalty (in their marital duties), then advise them, and keep away from them in beds, and (if that or nothing else worked) then spank them (fairly and not out of anger), but if they agreed with you, then do not look for a way against them. God is superior and great"
