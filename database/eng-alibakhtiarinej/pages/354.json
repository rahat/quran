And those among what your right hands own who ask for the certificate (of freedom), then write it for them if you know any good in them, and give them some of God’s possession that He gave you. And do not force your maids into prostitution looking for gain of this world’s life, if they want to be chaste. And if anyone forces them, then after their compulsion God is forgiving and merciful (to them)"

Example of His light is like a lamp holder with a lamp in it, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as if it is a brilliant star lit by (the oil of) a blessed olive tree, that is not facing east or west, and its oil almost glows (by itself) even though fire did not touch it. Light upon light, God guides whom He wants to His light. And God gives the examples for the people, and God knows everything"
