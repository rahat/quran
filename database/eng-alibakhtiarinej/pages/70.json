Say: indeed all the matters are up to God. They hide in themselves what they do not reveal to you, they say: if anything about the matter was up to us, we would not be killed here. Say: even if you stayed in your houses, those whom the death was written for them would come out to the place of their death. And God tests what is in your minds to purify what is in your hearts. God knows what is inside the minds"
