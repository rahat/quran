So if you find them as believing women, then do not return them to the disbelievers, they are not lawful for them (the disbelievers) and they (the disbelievers) are not lawful for them, and give them (the disbelievers) what they spent (for these women). And there is no blame on you if you marry them when you give them their compensations (marriage portions). And do not hold on to the (marriage) ties of disbelieving women, and ask for what you spent and they should ask for what they spent. This is God's command, He judges between you. God is knowledgeable and wise"
