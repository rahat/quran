He said: is it possible that you will not fight if you are prescribed to fight? They said: why should we not fight in God's way while we were driven from our homes and our children? But when the fight was prescribed to them, they turned away (and refused) except a few of them. God knows the wrongdoers"

They said: how can the rule over us be for him when we are more deserved to the rule than him and he is not given plenty (of wealth). He (their prophet) said: God chose him over you and greatly increased him in the knowledge and the body (physical strength), and God gives His rule to whomever He wants. God is bountiful and knowledgeable"
