    "text": "The desert Arabs who stayed behind are going to say to you: our possessions and our families kept us busy, so ask forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: who has any power for you against God, if He wants any harm for you or He wants any benefit for you? But God is well informed of what you do"
