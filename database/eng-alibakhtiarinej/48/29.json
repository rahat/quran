    "text": "Muhammad is God's messenger, and those with him are firm against the disbelievers and kind among themselves. You see them bowing down, showing humbleness, looking for Godâ€™s grace and pleasure. Their mark (appearance) is in their faces from effect of the humbleness. That is their example in the Torah, and their example in the Gospel: like a seed that brings out its shoots then strengthen it then becomes thick then it stands on its stem impressing the farmers, therefore He anger the disbelievers with them. God promised forgiveness and a great reward to those of them who believed and did good works"
