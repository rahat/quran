    "text": "They are those who disbelieved, and obstructed you from the Sacred Mosque, and the offering was prevented to reach its place (of sacrifice). And (you had attacked Mecca) if it was not for the believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you would have unknowingly trampled them and then you would have been afflicted by disgrace from them . For God admits anyone he wants into His mercy. If they (believers and disbelievers) were apart, We would have certainly punished those among them who disbelieved with a painful punishment"
