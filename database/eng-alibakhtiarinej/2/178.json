    "text": "You who believe, fair retaliation is prescribed for you in case of murder, the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female, but anyone who is forgiven in part by his brother (or the person in charge of victimâ€™s state) must follow with good intentions and pay (the ransom) with gratitude. This is a lightening/easement and a mercy from your Master. Whoever exceeds the limits after this will have a painful punishment"
