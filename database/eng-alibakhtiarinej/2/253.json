    "text": "These messengers, We preferred some of them over the others, God spoke to one and He raised ranks of some of them. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. And if God wanted, those after them would not have fought after the clear proofs came to them, but they disagreed, so some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if God wanted, they would not have fought, but God does what He wants"
