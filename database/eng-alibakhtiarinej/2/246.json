    "text": "Did you not see that after Moses, the leaders of children of Israel told their prophet: appoint a king for us that we fight in God's way. He said: is it possible that you will not fight if you are prescribed to fight? They said: why should we not fight in God's way while we were driven from our homes and our children? But when the fight was prescribed to them, they turned away (and refused) except a few of them. God knows the wrongdoers"
