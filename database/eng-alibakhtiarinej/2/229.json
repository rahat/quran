    "text": "Divorce is (permitted) twice, then either keeping in fairness, or leaving in kindness. And it is not allowed for you that you take back anything from what you gave them, unless they (both) are afraid of (violating) the limits set by God. And if you are afraid of (violating) the limits set by God, then there is no blame on either of them for what she gives back some of it (for her divorce). These are the limits set by God, so do not violate them, and whoever violates the limits set by God, then they are of the wrongdoers"
