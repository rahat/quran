    "text": "Mothers may nurse their children for two full years, for anyone who wants to complete the nursing. And the father is responsible for her appropriate food and clothing. No one is tasked beyond its capability. A mother should not sustain any loss because of her child, nor should a father because of his child, and the same (responsibility as the father) is on the heir. If they decide to stop (the nursing) after their mutual agreement and consultation, there is no blame on either of them. And if you decide to ask for a nursing mother for your children, there is no blame on you if you properly pay what you offered. Be cautious of God and know that God sees everything you do"
