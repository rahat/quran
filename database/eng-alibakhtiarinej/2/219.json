    "text": "They ask you about the wine (and alcoholic beverages) and the gambling. Say: there is great sin in both of them and benefits for the people, but their sin are greater than their benefit. They ask you what to spend, say: what you can give away (and let go of). This is how God makes the signs clear for you, so you may think"
