    "text": "They ask you about women's menstruation. Say: it is uncomfortable, so keep away from (having intercourse with) women during the menstruation, and do not go near them until they are clean, and when they are clean, then you may approach them from where God instructed you. God indeed loves those who repent and loves those who purify themselves"
