    "text": "You who believe, do not make your charities worthless by the reproach and annoyance, like someone who spends his wealth to be seen by people while he does not believe in God and the last day. His example is like a smooth rock with dust on it, then a heavy rain fell on it and left it bare (with no dust on it), they are not able (to benefit) from anything which they earned. And God does not guide the disbelieving people"
