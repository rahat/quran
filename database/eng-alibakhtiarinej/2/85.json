    "text": "Yet you are those who kill each other and drive some of you out of their homes, supporting (each other) against them in sins and enmity, and if they come to you as captives, you ask (or give) ransom for them while it was prohibited for you to drive them out. Do you believe in part of the book and disbelieve in (other) parts? So punishment of anyone among you who does this is disgrace in this life, and on the resurrection day they are sent back to the hardest punishment, and God is not unaware of what you do"
