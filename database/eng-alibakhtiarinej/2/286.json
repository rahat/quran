Our Master, do not hold it against us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Master, do not impose a burden on us as you imposed it on those before us. Our Master, do not impose on us what we cannot bear it and excuse us and forgive us and have mercy on us, You are our protector (and guardian), so help us against the disbelieving people"
