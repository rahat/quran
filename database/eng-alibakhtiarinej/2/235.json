    "text": "There is no blame on you for what you hint about it for proposing to women or keep it to yourselves. God knows that you are going to remember them. But do not make secret promises to them unless you speak properly. And do not decide on marriage tie before the prescribed term reaches its end. And know that God knows what is in your minds, so beware of Him, and know that God is forgiving and patient"
