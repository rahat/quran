    "text": "So when Talut (Saul) set out with the troops, he said: indeed God tests you with a river, anyone who drinks from it is not with me, and anyone who did not taste it or anyone who scoops a handful of it then he is indeed with me. So they all drank from it except a few of them. Then when he and those who believed with him crossed it (the river), they said: we do not have the strength to face Goliath and his troops today. Those who thought that they meet God said: many small forces overcame large forces by Godâ€™s permission, and God is with the patient ones (and those who persevere)"
