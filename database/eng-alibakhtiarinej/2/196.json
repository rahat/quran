And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination.

And when you are safe, then anyone who wishes to continue the Umrah on to the Hajj, then the offering (of sacrifice) that is easily available. And anyone who cannot find (or afford) it, should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return (from the Hajj), that is ten (days) in all. This is for anyone whose family does not reside near the Sacred Mosque. And be cautious of God and know that God is severe in punishment"
