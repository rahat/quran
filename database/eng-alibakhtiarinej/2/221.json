    "text": "Do not marry the polytheist women until they believe, and (marrying) a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist, even if she impresses you. And do not give (your women) in marriage to the polytheist men until they believe, and (marrying) a believing slave man is better than a polytheist, even if he impresses you. These invite into the fire, while God invites to the garden and the forgiveness by His permission. And He makes His signs clear for the people, that they may take notice"
