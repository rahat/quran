    "text": "Did you not see the one, who God gave him the rule, argued with Abraham about his Master? When Abraham said: my Master is the One who gives life and causes death. He said: I (also) give life and cause death. Abraham said: God indeed brings (rises) the sun from the east, so you make it rise from the west. So the one who disbelieved was stunned. God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
