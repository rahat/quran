    "text": "People were a single community, then God sent the prophets, givers of good news and warners, and He sent down the book with them in truth, to judge between people in what they disagreed about it. And only those who were given it (the book), disagreed about it because of envy between them after the clear proofs came to them. So, God guided those who believed with His permission, regarding what they disagreed about it from the truth. God guides whom He wants to a straight path"
