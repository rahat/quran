    "text": "Month of Ramadan is the one in which Quran, a guide for the people and clear evidences of the guidance and the criterion (of right and wrong), was sent down. So anyone of you who sees the month should fast in it. And anyone who is sick or traveling, then (he should fast) a number of other days. God wants ease for you and He does not want difficulty for you, so that you complete the (mandated) number, and so that you magnify God for guiding you, and you may be thankful"
