    "text": "People, if you are in doubt about the resurrection, then (consider that) indeed We created you from dust, then from fertilized egg (Zygote), then from a (dangling, clinging, and leach like) blood clot, then from a piece of chewed flesh (embryo) formed and unformed in order to clarify for you (that We are capable of everything). And We settle what We want in the wombs for a limited period, then We bring you out as a baby, then you reach your full maturity (and strength), and some of you die and some of you are returned to the lowest part of life, so that they do not know anything after knowing (and they forget everything). And you see the earth barren (and lifeless), then when We send down the rain on it, it revives and grows and produces all types of beautiful (plants)"
