    "text": "and We only made the angels as guardians of the fire and We made their numbers (nineteen) only as a test for those who disbelieved, so that those who were given the book would be certain and to increase the belief of those who believed, and those who were given the book and the believers would not doubt, and so that those who have a disease in their hearts and the disbelievers say: what did God intend with this example. That is how God misguides anyone He wants and guides anyone He wants. And none knows God's soldiers except Him. And this is only a reminder for the human being"
