    "text": "He is the One who drove out those who disbelieved among the people of the book from their homes for the first forced emigration. You did not think that they would leave. And they thought that their fortresses would protect them against God, but God came to them from where they did not expect, and He threw horror in their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the believers' hands. So you who have insight, learn a lesson"
