These are disobedience. Today those who disbelieved lost hope about your religion (way of life), so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I completed your religion for you and I finished my favor upon you and I chose the submission (Islam) as a religion for you. If anyone is forced by hunger, not intentionally committing a sin, then God is forgiving and merciful"
