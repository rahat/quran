And one quarter of what you leave is for them if you don't have a child, and if you have a child then one eighth of what you leave is for them, after fulfilling the will that you instructed to it or paying off any debt. And if a man or a woman who is to be inherited from has no direct heir and he has a brother or a sister, for each one of them is one sixth, and if more than two, then they all share in a third, after fulfilling the will that he instructed to it and paying off any debt without causing any loss. This is an instruction from God, and God is Knowledgeable and patient"
