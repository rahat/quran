God determines (length of) the night and the day, and He knows that you never calculate it, so He turned to you (in mercy), therefore read as much as you can from Quran. He knows that some of you are going to get sick and others move around on the earth looking for His bounty and others fight in God's way, so read as much as you can from it, and perform the mandatory prayer and give to mandatory charity and lend God a good loan (or offer God a good deed). And whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you find it as a better and greater reward with God. And ask forgiveness of God, as God is indeed forgiving and merciful"
