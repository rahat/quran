So he shall write, and the borrower should dictate, and he should be cautious of God, his Master, and should not reduce (or eliminate) anything from it. And if the borrower is retarded or is a child or is unable to dictate, then his guardian should dictate in justice. And ask two witnesses from among your men to witness, and if there are not two men, then one man and two women from the witnesses who are acceptable to you, so if one of the two makes a mistake (or forgets) then the other one of the two may remind the other one. And the witnesses should not refuse (to testify) if they are called upon. And they should not be reluctant to write it no matter how small or large, along with its term. This is fairer in God’s view, and more upstanding for the testimony, and closer that you do not have doubts. Except if it is a face to face transaction that (the actual merchandise or money) changes hands between you, then there will be no blame on you if you do not write it. And take witness when you buy and sell. And the writer and the witness should not be harmed, and if you do (harm them) it is indeed disobedience on your part. And be cautious of God, and God teaches you (what to do). God knows everything"
