Indeed that is annoying the prophet, but he is shy from you, but God is not shy about the truth. And when you ask them (prophet’s wives) for anything, then ask them from behind a curtain (or a partition). That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to annoy God’s messenger, and do not ever marry his wives after him, indeed that is awful in God's sight"
