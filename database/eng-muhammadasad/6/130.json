Have there not come unto you apostles from among yourselves, who conveyed unto you My messages and warned you of the coming of this your Day [of Judgment]?\" They will answer: \"We do bear witness against ourselves!\"-for the life of this world had beguiled them: and so they will bear witness against themselves that they had been denying the truth"
