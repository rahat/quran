    "text": "[And in times to come] some will say, \"[They were] three, the fourth of them being their dog,\" while others will say, \"Five, with their dog as the sixth of them\" -idly guessing at something of which they can have no knowledge -and [so on, until] some will say, \"[They were] seven, the eighth of them being their dog.\" Say: \"My Sustainer knows best how many they were. None but a few have any [real] knowledge of them. Hence, do not argue about them otherwise than by way of an obvious argument, and do not ask any of those [story-tellers] to enlighten thee about them"
