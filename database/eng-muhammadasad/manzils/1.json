Believe, then, in God and His apostles, and do not say, \"[God is] a trinity\". Desist [from this assertion] for your own good. God is but One God; utterly remote is He, in His glory, from having a son: unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and none is as worthy of trust as God"

But if there are two sisters, both [together] shall have two-thirds of what he has left; and if there are brothers and sisters, then the male shall have the equal of two females' share.\" God makes [all this] clear unto you, lest you go astray; and God knows everything"
