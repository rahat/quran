One of them said: \"Behold, I saw myself [in a dream] pressing wine.\" And the other said: \"Behold, I saw myself [in a dream] carrying bread on my head, and birds were eating thereof.\" [And both entreated Joseph:] \"Let us know the real meaning of this! Verily, we see that thou art one of those who know well [how to interpret dreams]"
