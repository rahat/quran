    "text": "THEY WILL ASK thee to enlighten them. Say: \"God enlightens you [thus] about the laws concerning [inheritance from] those who leave no heir in the direct line: If a man dies childless and has a sister, she shall inherit one-half of what he has left, just as he shall inherit from her if she dies childless. But if there are two sisters, both [together] shall have two-thirds of what he has left; and if there are brothers and sisters, then the male shall have the equal of two females' share.\" God makes [all this] clear unto you, lest you go astray; and God knows everything"
