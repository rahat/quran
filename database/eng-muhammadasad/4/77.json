But as soon as fighting [in God's cause] is ordained for them, lo, some of them stand in awe of men as one should stand in awe of God - or in even greater awe - and say, \"O our Sustainer! Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us? If only Thou hadst granted us a delay for a little while!\" Say: \"Brief is the enjoyment of this world, whereas the life to come is the best for all who are conscious of God - since none of you shall be wronged by as much as a hair's breadth"
