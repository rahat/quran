    "text": "AND THEY will ask thee to enlighten them about the laws concerning women. Say: \"God [Himself] enlightens you about the laws concerning them\"- for [His will is shown] in what is being conveyed unto you through this divine writ about orphan women [in your charge], to whom - because you yourselves may be desirous of marrying them - you do not give that which has been ordained for them; and about helpless children; and about your duty to treat orphans with equity. And whatever good you may do - behold, God has indeed full knowledge thereof"
