    "text": "Among those of the Jewish faith there are some who distort the meaning of the [revealed] words, taking them out of their context and saying, [as it were,] \"We have heard, but we disobey,\" and, \"Hear without hearkening,” and, “Hearken thou unto us, (O Muhammad)” - thus making a play with their tongues, and implying that the [true] Faith is false. And had they but said, \"We have heard, and we pay heed,\" and \"Hear [us], and have patience with us,\" it would indeed have been for their own good, and more upright: but God has rejected them because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth - for it is in but few things that they believe"
