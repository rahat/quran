    "text": "And when Saul set out with his forces, he said: \"Behold, God will now try you by a river: he who shall drink of it will not belong to me, whereas he who shall refrain from tasting it - he, indeed, will belong to me; but forgiven shall be he who shall scoop up but a single handful.\" However, save for a few of them, they all drank [their fill] of it. And as soon as he and those who had kept faith with him had crossed the river, the others said: \"No strength have we today [to stand up] against Goliath and his forces!\" [Yet] those who knew with certainty that they were destined to meet God, replied: \"How often has a small host overcome a great host by God's leave! For God is with those who are patient in adversity"
