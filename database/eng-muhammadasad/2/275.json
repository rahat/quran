    "text": "THOSE who gorge themselves on usury behave but as he might behave whom Satan has confounded with his touch; for they say, \"Buying and selling is but a kind of usury\" - the while God has made buying and selling lawful and usury unlawful. Hence, whoever becomes aware of his Sustainer's admonition, and thereupon desists [from usury], may keep his past gains, and it will be for God to judge him; but as for those who return to it -they are destined for the fire, therein to abide"
