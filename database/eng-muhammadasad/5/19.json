Now, after a long time during which no apostles have appeared, there has come unto you [this] Our Apostle to make [the truth] clear to you, lest you say, \"No bearer of glad tidings has come unto us, nor any warner \": for now there has come unto you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner -since God has the power to will anything"
