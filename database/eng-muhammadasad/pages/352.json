And were it not for God’s favour upon you and His grace, not one of you would ever have remained pure. For [thus it is:] God who causes whomever He wills to grow in purity: for God is all-hearing, all-knowing"

[For,] do you not desire that God should forgive you your sins, seeing that God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
