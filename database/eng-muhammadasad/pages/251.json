Hence, the prayer of those who deny the truth amounts to no more than losing oneself in grievous error"

In this way does God set forth the parable of truth and falsehood: for, as far as the scum is concerned, it passes away as [does all] dross; but that which is of benefit to man abides on earth. In this way does God set forth the parables"
