And as soon as he and those who had kept faith with him had crossed the river, the others said: \"No strength have we today [to stand up] against Goliath and his forces!\" [Yet] those who knew with certainty that they were destined to meet God, replied: \"How often has a small host overcome a great host by God's leave! For God is with those who are patient in adversity"
