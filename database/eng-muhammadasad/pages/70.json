Be not like those who are bent on denying the truth and say of their brethren [who die] after having set out on a journey to faraway places or gone forth to war, \"Had they but remained with us, they would not have died,\" or, \"they would not have been slain\" - for God will cause such thoughts to become a source of bitter regret in their hearts, since it is God who grants life and deals death.
