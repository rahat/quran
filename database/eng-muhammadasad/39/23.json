    "text": "God bestows from on high the best of all teachings in the shape of a divine writ fully consistent within itself, repeating each statement [of the truth] in manifold forms [a divine writ] whereat shiver the skins of all who of their Sustainer stand in awe: [but] in the end their skins and their hearts do soften at the remembrance of [the grace of] God. Such is Godâ€™s guidance: He guides therewith him that wills [to be guided] whereas he whom God lets go astray can never find any guide"
