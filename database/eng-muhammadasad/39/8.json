    "text": "NOW [thus it is:] when affliction befalls man, he is likely to cry out to his Sustainer, turning unto Him [for help]; but as soon as He has bestowed upon him a boon by His grace, he forgets Him whom he invoked before, and claims that there are other powers that could rival God - and thus leads [others] astray from His path. Say [unto him who sins in this way]: â€œEnjoy thyself for a while in this thy denial of the truth; [yet,] verily, thou art of those who are destined for the fire"
