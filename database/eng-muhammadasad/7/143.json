    "text": "And when Moses came [to Mount Sinai] at the time set by Us, and his Sustainer spoke unto him, he said: \"O my Sustainer! Show [Thyself] unto me, so that I might behold Thee!\" Said [God]: \"Never canst thou see Me. However, behold this mountain: if it remains firm in its place, then - only then - wilt thou see Me. And as soon as his Sustainer revealed His glory to the mountain, He caused it to crumble to dust; and Moses fell down in a swoon. And when he came to himself, he said: \"Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! Unto Thee do I turn in repentance; and I shall [always] be the first to believe in Thee"
