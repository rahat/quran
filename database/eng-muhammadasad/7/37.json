Whatever has been decreed to be their lot [in life] will be theirs -till there shall come _ unto them Our messengers to cause them to die, [and] shall say, \"Where, now, are those beings whom you were wont to invoke beside God?\" And [those sinners] will reply, \"They have forsaken us!\" -and [thus] they will bear witness against themselves that they had been denying the truth"
