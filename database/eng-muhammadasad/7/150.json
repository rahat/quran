    "text": "And when Moses returned to his people, full of wrath and sorrow, he exclaimed: \"Vile is the course which you have followed in my absence! Have you forsaken your Sustainer's commandment?\" And he threw down the tablets [of the Law], and seized his brother's head, dragging him towards himself. Cried Aaron: \"O my mother's son! Behold, the people brought me low and almost slew me: so let not mine enemies rejoice at my affliction, and count me not among the evildoing folk"
