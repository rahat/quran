And as soon as he and those who had kept faith with him had crossed the river, the others said: \"No strength have we today [to stand up] against Goliath and his forces!\" [Yet] those who knew with certainty that they were destined to meet God, replied: \"How often has a small host overcome a great host by God's leave! For God is with those who are patient in adversity"

And We vouchsafed unto Jesus, the son of Mary, all evidence of the truth, and strengthened him with holy inspiration. And if God had so willed, they who succeeded those [apostles] would not have contended with one another after all evidence of the truth had come to them; but [as it was,] they did take to divergent views, and some of them attained to faith, while some of them came to deny the truth. Yet if God had so willed, they would not have contended with one another: but God does whatever He wills"
