Believe, then, in God and His apostles, and do not say, \"[God is] a trinity\". Desist [from this assertion] for your own good. God is but One God; utterly remote is He, in His glory, from having a son: unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and none is as worthy of trust as God"
