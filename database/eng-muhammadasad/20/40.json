And so We returned thee unto thy mother, so that her eye be gladdened, and that she might not sorrow [any longer]. \"And [when thou camest of age, thou didst slay a man: but We did save thee from all grief, although We tried thee with various trials. \"And then thou didst sojourn for years among the people of Madyan; and now thou hast come [here] as ordained [by Me], O Moses"
