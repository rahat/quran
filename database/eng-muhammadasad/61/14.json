Be helpers [in the cause of God - even as Jesus, the son of Mary, said unto the white-garbed ones, \"Who will be my helpers in God's cause?\" - whereupon the white-garbed [disciples] replied, \"We shall be [thy] helpers [in the cause] of God!\" And so [it happened that] some of the children of Israel came to believe [in the apostleship of Jesus], whereas others denied the truth. But [now] We have given strength against their foes unto those who have [truly] attained to faith: and they have become the ones that shall prevail"
