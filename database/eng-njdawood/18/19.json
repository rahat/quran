One of them asked: ‘How long have you stayed here?‘ They said: ‘We have stayed one day, or part of a day.‘ They said: ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed here. Let one of you go to the city with this silver coin and bring you back whatever food he finds most wholesome there. Let him conduct himself with caution and not disclose your whereabouts to anyone"
