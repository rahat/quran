    "text": "Believers, if you go to fight for the cause of God, show discernment and do not say to him that offers you peace: ‘You are not a believer,‘ seeking the chance booty of this world; for with God there are abundant gains. Such was your custom in days gone by, but now God has bestowed on you His grace. Therefore show discernment; God is cognizant of what you do"
