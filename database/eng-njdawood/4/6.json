    "text": "Put orphans to the test until they reach a marriageable age. If you find them capable of sound judgement, hand over to them their property, and do not cheat them of it by squandering it before they come of age. Let not the rich guardian touch the property of his orphan ward; and let him who is poor use no more than a fair portion of it for his own advantage. When you hand over to them their property, call in some witnesses to be present; sufficient is Godâ€˜s reckoning"
