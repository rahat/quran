    "text": "If any one of you cannot afford to marry a believing free woman, let him marry a slave-girl who is a believer (God best knows your faith: you are born one of another). Marry them with their masterâ€˜s permission and give them their dowry in all justice, provided they are honourable and chaste and have not courted other men. If after marriage they commit a lewd act, they shall suffer half the penalty inflicted upon free women. Such is the provision for those of you who fear impropriety: but if you abstain, it will be better for you. God is forgiving and compassionate"
