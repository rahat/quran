If God grants you victory, they say: ‘Did we not stand on your side?‘ And if it be the unbelievers‘ turn, they say to them: ‘Were we not mightier than you, and did we not protect you from the faithful?‘ God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. God will not let the unbelievers triumph over the faithful"
