    "text": "Believers, do not approach your prayers when you are drunk, until you know what you are saying; nor when you are unclean ― unless you are travelling the road ― until you have washed yourselves. If you are sick or on a journey, or if, when you have relieved yourselves or had intercourse with women, you can find no water, take some clean sand and rub your faces and your hands with it. God will surely pardon and forgiving"
