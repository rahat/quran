    "text": "Men have authority over women because God has made the one superior to the other, and because they spend their wealth to maintain them. Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them, and forsake them in bedsÂ³ apart, and beat them. Then if they obey you, take no further action against them. Surely God is high, supreme"
