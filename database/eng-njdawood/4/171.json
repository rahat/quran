    "text": "People of the Book,¹ do not transgress the bounds of your religion. Speak nothing but the Truth about God. The Christ, Jesus son of Mary, was no more than God‘s apostle and His Word which He cast to Mary: a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His apostles and do not say: ‘Three.‘ Forbear, and it shall be better for you. Surely God is but one God; God forbid that He should have a son! His is all that the heavens and the earth contain. Sufficient is God as a patron"
