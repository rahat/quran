    "text": "PROPHET (AND you believers), if you divorce your wives, divorce them at the end of their waiting period. Compute their waiting period and fear God, your Lord. You shall not expel them from their homes, nor shall they go away, unless they have committed a proven lewd act. Such are the bounds set by God; he that transgresses Godâ€˜s bounds wrongs his own soul. You never know; after that, God may bring about some new event"
