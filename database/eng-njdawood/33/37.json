    "text": "You³ said to the man⁴ whom God and yourself have favoured: ‘Keep your wife and have fear of God.‘ You sought to hide in your heart what God was to reveal.¹ You were afraid of man, although it would have been more proper for you to fear God. And when Zayd divorced her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it should become legitimate for true believers to wed the wives of their adopted sons if they had divorced them. God‘s will must needs be done"
