    "text": "God has now revealed the best of Scriptures, a Book uniform in style proclaiming promises and warnings. Those who fear their Lord tremble with awe at its revelations, and their skins and hearts melt at the remembrance of God. Such is Godâ€˜s guidance: He guides whom He will. But he whom God confounds shall have none to guide him"
