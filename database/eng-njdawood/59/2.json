    "text": "He it was that drove the unbelievers among the People of the Book out of their dwellings into the first exile.ยน You did not think that they would go; and they, for their part, fancied that their strongholds would protect them from God. But God smote them whence they did not expect it, casting such terror into their hearts that their dwellings were destroyed by their own hands as well as by the faithful. Learn from their example, you that have eyes"
