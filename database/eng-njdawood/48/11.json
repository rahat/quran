    "text": "The desert Arabs who stayed behind³ will say to you: ‘We were occupied with our goods and families. Implore God to pardon us.‘ They will say with their tongues what they do not mean in their hearts. Say: ‘Who can intervene on your behalf with God if it be His will to do you harm or good? Indeed, God is cognizant of what you do.‘"
