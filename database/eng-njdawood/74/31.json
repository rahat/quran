    "text": "We have appointed none but angels to guard the Fire, and made their number a subject for dispute among the unbelievers, so that those to whom the Book were given may be convinced and the true believers strengthened in their faith; that those to whom the Book were given, and the true believers, may have no doubts; and that those whose hearts are tainted and unbelievers may say: ‘What could God mean by this as an example?‘ Thus God confounds whom He will and guides whom He pleases. None knows the warriors of your Lord but Himself. This is no more than an Admonition to mankind"
