    "text": "They ask you about the sacred month and about fighting therein. Say: ‘To fight in this month is a grave offence; but to debar people from the path of God, to blaspheme against Him and against the Holy Mosque, and to expel its worshippers from it, is more grievous in God‘s sight. Idolatry¹ is more grievous than bloodshed.‘ They will not cease to fight you until they force you to renounce your religion ― if they are able. But whoever among you renounces his religion and dies an unbeliever, his works shall come to nothing in this world and in the world to come. Such shall be the tenants of the Fire, wherein shall they abide for ever"
