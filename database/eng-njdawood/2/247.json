    "text": "Their prophet said to them: ‘God has appointed Saul to be your king.‘ They replied: ‘Why should he be given the kingship, when we are more deserving of it than he? Besides, he has not been given abundant wealth.‘ He said: ‘God has chosen him to rule over you and made him grow in knowledge and in stature. God gives His sovereignty to whom He will. God is munificent and all-knowing.‘"
