    "text": "DivorceÂ¹ may be pronounced twice, and then a woman shall be retained in honour or allowed to go with kindness. It is unlawful for you to take from them anything you gave them, unless both fear that they may not be able to keep within the bounds set by God; in which case it shall be no offence for either of them if the wife redeems herself. These are the bounds set by God; do not transgress them. Those that transgress the bounds of God are assuredly the wrongdoers"
