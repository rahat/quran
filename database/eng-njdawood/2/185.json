    "text": "It was in the month of Ramaḑān that the Koran was revealed, a guide for mankind with proofs of guidance and Salvation.² Therefore whoever of you is present in that month let him fast. And he who is ill or on a journey shall fast a similar number of days later on. God desires your well-being, not your discomfort. He desires you to fast the whole month so that you may magnify God for His guidance and render thanks"
