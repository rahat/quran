    "text": "And provide for them; the rich man according to his means and the poor according to his: a fair provision. This is incumbent on men of virtue. And if you divorce them before the marriage is consummated, but after their dowry has been settled, give them the half of their dowry, unless they or the husband agree to waive it. But it is more proper and decent that the husband should waive it. Do not forget to show kindness to each other. God is cognizant of what you do"
