    "text": "Or of him, who, when passing by a ruined and desolate city, remarked: ‘How can God give life to this city, now that it is dead?‘ Thereupon God caused him to die, and after a hundred years brought him back to life. ‘How long have you been here?‘ God asked. ‘A day,‘ he replied, ‘or part of a day.‘ God said: ‘You have been here a hundred years. Yet look at your food and drink: they have not rotted. And look at your ass. We will make of you a sign for the people: and look at the bones, how We will revive them and clothe them with flesh.‘ And when it had all become manifest to him, he said: ‘Now I know that God has power over all things.‘"
