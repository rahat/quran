    "text": "But those that give away their wealth from a desire to please God and to reassure their own souls can be compared to an orchard on a hill-side: if a shower falls upon it, it yields up twice its normal produce; and if no shower falls upon it, itâ€˜s watered by the dew. God is cognizant of what you do"
