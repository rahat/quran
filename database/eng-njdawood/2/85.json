    "text": "Yet there you were, slaying your own kin, and turning a number of you out of their dwellings, and helping each other against them with sin and aggression; though had they come to you as captives, You would have ransomed them. Surely their expulsion was unlawful. Do you believe in one part of the Book and deny another? So what reward is there for those of you that act thus but disgrace in this world and grievous punishment on the Day of Resurrection. God is never heedless of what you do"
