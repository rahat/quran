They teach the people witchcraft and that which was revealed to the angels Hārūt and Mārūt in Babylon. Yet they never instruct any without saying beforehand: ‘We have been sent only to tempt you; do not blaspheme.‘ From these two, they learn that which creates discord between husband and wife, although they can harm none with what they learn except by God‘s leave. They learn what harms them and does not profit them; yet they know full well that anyone who engaged in that traffic would have no share in the life to come. Vile is that for which they have sold their souls, if they but knew it"
