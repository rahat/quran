    "text": "Have you not thought of him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because He had bestowed sovereignty upon him? Abraham said: ‘My Lord is He who has the power over life and death.‘ ‘I, too,‘ replied the other, ‘have the power over life and death.‘ ‘God brings up the sun from the east,‘ said Abraham. ‘Bring it up yourself from the west.‘ The unbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoers"
