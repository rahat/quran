    "text": "Thus have We made you a just community, so that you may testify against mankind and that your own Apostle may testify against you. We decreed your former qiblah only in order that We might know the Apostle‘s true adherents and those who were to disown him. It was indeed a hard test, but not to those whom God has guided. God‘s aim was not to make your faith fruitless. God is benignant and compassionate to mankind"
