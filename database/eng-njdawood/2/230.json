    "text": "If a man divorcesÂ² his wife, he shall not remarry her until she has wedded another man and been divorced by him; in which case it shall be no offence for either of them to return to the other, if they think that they can keep within the bounds set by God. Such are the bounds of God. He makes them plain to those endowed with knowledge"
