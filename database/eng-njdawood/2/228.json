    "text": "Divorced women must wait, keeping themselves from men, three menstrual courses. It is unlawful for them, if they believe in God and the Last Day, to hide what God has created in their wombs: in which case their husbands would do more justly to take them back, should they desire reconciliation. Women shall with justice have rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have a status above them. God is mighty and wise"
