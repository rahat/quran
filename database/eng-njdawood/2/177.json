    "text": "Righteousness does not consist in whether you turn your face to the East or to the West. The righteous are those who believes in God and the Last Day, in the angels and the Book and the prophets; who, though they love it dearly, gives their wealth to kin, to orphans, to the destitute, to the traveller in need and to beggars, and for the redemption of captives; who attend to their prayers and renders the alms levy; who are true to their promises and steadfast in trial and adversity and in times of war. Such are the true believers; such are the God-fearing"
