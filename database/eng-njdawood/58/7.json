    "text": "Are you not aware that God knows what the heavens and the earth contain? If three men confer in secret, He is their fourth; if five, He is their sixth; whether fewer or more, He is with them wherever they be. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of their doings. God has knowledge of all things"
