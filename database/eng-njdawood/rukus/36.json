Abraham said: ‘My Lord is He who has the power over life and death.‘ ‘I, too,‘ replied the other, ‘have the power over life and death.‘ ‘God brings up the sun from the east,‘ said Abraham. ‘Bring it up yourself from the west.‘ The unbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoers"

Yet look at your food and drink: they have not rotted. And look at your ass. We will make of you a sign for the people: and look at the bones, how We will revive them and clothe them with flesh.‘ And when it had all become manifest to him, he said: ‘Now I know that God has power over all things.‘"

Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that God is mighty and wise.‘"
