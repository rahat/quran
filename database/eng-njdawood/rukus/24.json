He has relented towards you and pardoned you. Therefore you may now lie with them and seek what God has ordained for you. Eat and drink until you can tell a white thread from a black one in the light of the coming dawn. Then resume the fast till nightfall and do not approach them, when you should be preoccupied with your prayers in the mosques. These are the bounds set by God: do not approach them. Thus God makes known His revelations to mankind that they may guard themselves against evil"
