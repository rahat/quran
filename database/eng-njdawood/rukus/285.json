If you doubt the Resurrection remember that We had created you from dust, then from a living germ, then from a clot of blood,² and then from a half-formed lump of flesh, so that We might manifest to you Our power. We cause to remain in the womb whatever We please for an appointed term, and then We bring you forth as infants, that you may grow up and reach your prime. Some among you die young, and some live on to abject old age when all that they once knew they know no more. You sometimes see the earth dry and barren: but no sooner do We send the water down upon it than it begins to stir and swell, putting forth every kind of radiant bloom"
