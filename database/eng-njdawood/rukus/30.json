It is unlawful for you to take from them anything you gave them, unless both fear that they may not be able to keep within the bounds set by God; in which case it shall be no offence for either of them if the wife redeems herself. These are the bounds set by God; do not transgress them. Those that transgress the bounds of God are assuredly the wrongdoers"

But you shall not retain them in order to harm them or to wrong them. Whoever does this wrongs his own soul. Do not trifle with God‘s revelations. Remember the favour God has bestowed upon you, and the Book and the wisdom He has revealed for your instruction. Fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things"
