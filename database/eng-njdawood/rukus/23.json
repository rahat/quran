The righteous are those who believes in God and the Last Day, in the angels and the Book and the prophets; who, though they love it dearly, gives their wealth to kin, to orphans, to the destitute, to the traveller in need and to beggars, and for the redemption of captives; who attend to their prayers and renders the alms levy; who are true to their promises and steadfast in trial and adversity and in times of war. Such are the true believers; such are the God-fearing"
