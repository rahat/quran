    "text": "No burdened soul shall bear anotherâ€˜s burden. If a laden soul cries out for help, not even a near relation shall share its burden. You shall admonish none but those who fear their Lord though they cannot see Him, and are steadfast in prayer. He that keeps himself pure surely keeps pure for his own soul. To God is the final return"
