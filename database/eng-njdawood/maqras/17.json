We gave Jesus son of Mary conspicuous signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Had God pleased, those who succeeded them would not have fought each other after the conspicuous signs had been given them. But they disagreed among themselves; some had faith and others had none. And had God pleased they would not have fought each other; but God does what He will"

His throne is as vast as the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does not weary Him. He is the Exalted, the Immense One"

Yet look at your food and drink: they have not rotted. And look at your ass. We will make of you a sign for the people: and look at the bones, how We will revive them and clothe them with flesh.‘ And when it had all become manifest to him, he said: ‘Now I know that God has power over all things.‘"
