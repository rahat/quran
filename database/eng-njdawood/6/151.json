    "text": "Say: ‘Come, I will tell you what your Lord has made unlawful for you: that you shall serve no other gods besides Him; that you shall show kindness to your parents; that you shall not kill your children because you cannot support them: We provide for you and for them; that you shall not commit lewd acts, whether openly or in secret; and that you shall not kill, for that is forbidden by God ― except for a just cause. Thus does He exhort you, that you may grow in wisdom.‘"
