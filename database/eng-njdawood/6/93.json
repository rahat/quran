    "text": "Who is more wicked than he who invents a falsehood about God, or says: ‘This was revealed to me,‘ when nothing was revealed to him? Or says: ‘I can reveal the like of what God has revealed‘? Could you but see the wrongdoers when death overwhelms them! With hands outstretched, the angels will say: ‘Yield up your souls this day. You shall be rewarded with the scourge of shame, for you have said of God what is untrue and scorned His revelations"
