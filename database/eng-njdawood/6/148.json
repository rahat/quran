    "text": "The idolaters will say: ‘Had God pleased, neither we nor our fathers would have served other gods besides Him; nor would we have declared anything unlawful.‘ In like manner did those who have gone before them disbelieve until they felt Our might. Say: ‘Have you any knowledge you can put before us? You believe in nothing but conjecture and follow nothing but falsehoods.‘"
