Are we to turn upon our heels after God has guided us, like him who, being bewitched by demons in the land, blunders along perplexed, although his friends call him to the right path, shouting: \"Come this way!\"?‘ Say: ‘God‘s guidance is the only guidance. We are commanded to submit to the Lord of the Universe"
