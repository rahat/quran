    "text": "And one of Pharaoh‘s kin, who in secret was a true believer, said: ‘Would you kill a man merely because he says: \"My Lord is God\"? He has brought you veritable signs from your Lord. If he is lying, may his lie be on his head; but if he is speaking the truth, some of what he threatens you with will smite you. God does not guide a lying transgressor"
