    "text": "When you meet the unbelievers strike off their heads and, when you have wrecked widespread slaughter among them, bind your captives firmly. Then either grant them their freedom or take a ransom from them, until War shall lay down her burdens. Thus shall you do. Had God willed, He could Himself have punished them; but thus shall it be that He may test you, the one by the other. As for those who are slain in the cause of God, He will not bring their deeds to nothing"
