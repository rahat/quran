    "text": "They ask you about the Hour: when will it come? Say: ‘None but my Lord has knowledge of it.² Only He will reveal it ― at the appointed time. A fateful hour shall it be, both in the heavens and on earth. It will but suddenly overtake you.‘ They will put questions to you as though you were privy to it. Say: ‘Only God has knowledge of it, but the greater part of mankind do not know this.‘"
