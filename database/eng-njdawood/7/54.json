    "text": "Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then ascended the throne. He throws the veil of night over the day; swiftly they follow one another. And the sun and the moon and the stars â€• all subservient to His will. His is the creation, His the command. Blessed be God, Lord of the Universe"
