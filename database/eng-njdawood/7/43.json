    "text": "We shall take away all rancour from their hearts. Rivers will roll at their feet and they shall say: ‘Praise be to God who has guided us hither. Had He not given us guidance we would not have been rightly guided. Our Lord‘s apostles have surely preached the Truth.‘ And a voice will cry out to them: ‘This is the Paradise you inherited for what you did.‘"
