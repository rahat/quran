    "text": "He will say: ‘Enter, and join communities of jinn and humankind that have gone before you into the Fire.‘ As it enters, every community will curse the one that went before it, and when all are gathered there, the last of them will say of the first: ‘These, Lord, have led us astray. Let their punishment be doubled in the Fire.‘ He will say: ‘All shall be doubly punished, though you may know not.‘"
