    "text": "And when Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful, he said: ‘Evil is the thing you did in my absence! Would you hasten the ordinance of your Lord?‘ He threw down the Tablets and, seizing his brother‘s head, dragged him closer to him. ‘Son of my mother,‘ Aaron said, ‘the people overpowered me and almost did me to death. Do not let the enemy gloat over me; do not number me among the wrongdoers.‘"
