    "text": "Fight for the cause of God with the devotion due to Him. He has chosen you, and laid on you no burdens in the observance of your Religion, the faith of your father Abraham. In this, as in former scriptures, He has given you the name of Muslims, so that the Apostle may testify against you, and that you may yourselves testify against people. Therefore attend to your prayers, render the alms levy, and hold fast to God; for He is your guardian. A gracious guardian and a gracious helper"
