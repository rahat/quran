    "text": "those who have been unjustly driven from their homes, only because they said: ‘Our Lord is God.‘ Had God not defended some by the might of others, monasteries and churches, synagogues and mosques in which His praise is daily celebrated, would have been utterly destroyed. But whoever helps God shall surely be helped by Him: God is powerful and mighty"
