But you shall not retain them in order to harm them or to wrong them. Whoever does this wrongs his own soul. Do not trifle with God‘s revelations. Remember the favour God has bestowed upon you, and the Book and the wisdom He has revealed for your instruction. Fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things"

This is enjoined on every one of you who believes in God and the Last Day; this is more honourable for you and more chaste. God knows, and you know not"

They must be maintained and clothed in a reasonable manner by the child‘s father. None should be charged with more than one can bear. A mother shall not be allowed to suffer on account of her child, nor shall a father on account of his child. The same duties devolve upon the father‘s heir. But if, by mutual consent and consultation, they choose to wean the child, they shall incur no guilt. Nor shall it be any offence for you if you prefer to have a nurse for your children, provided that you pay her what you promise, according to usage. Fear God, and know that God is cognizant of what you do"
