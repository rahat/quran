Say: ‘All is in the hands of God.‘ They conceal in their minds what they do not reveal to you. They complain: ‘Had we had any say in the matter, we should not have been slain here.‘ Say: ‘Had you stayed in your homes, those of you who were destined to be slain would have died in their beds; for it was God‘s will to test what was in your bosoms and to scrutinize what was in your hearts. God has full knowledge of one‘s innermost thoughts.‘"

God has power over life and death, and God is ever observant of what you do"
