He that drinks from it shall be no soldier of mine, but he that does not drink from it, or scoops a little in the hollow of his hand, shall fight by my side.‘¹ They all drank from it, except a few of them. And when he had crossed the river with those who shared his faith, they said: ‘We have no power this day against Goliath and his warriors.‘ Those of them who believed that they would meet God said: ‘Many a small band has, by God‘s grace, vanquished a mighty army. God is with those who endure with fortitude.‘"
