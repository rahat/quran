But do not arrange to meet them in secret, and if you do, speak to them honourably, and you shall not consummate the marriage before the end of their waiting period. Know that God has knowledge of all that is in your minds. Therefore fear Him and know that God is forgiving and lenient"

And if you divorce them before the marriage is consummated, but after their dowry has been settled, give them the half of their dowry, unless they or the husband agree to waive it. But it is more proper and decent that the husband should waive it. Do not forget to show kindness to each other. God is cognizant of what you do"
