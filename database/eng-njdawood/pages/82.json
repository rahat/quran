All women other than these are lawful for you, provided you court them with your wealth in modest conduct, not in fornication. Give them their dowry for the enjoyment you have had of them as a duty; but it shall be no offence for you to make any other agreement among yourselves after you have fulfilled your duty. Surely God is all-knowing and wise"

Marry them with their masterâ€˜s permission and give them their dowry in all justice, provided they are honourable and chaste and have not courted other men. If after marriage they commit a lewd act, they shall suffer half the penalty inflicted upon free women. Such is the provision for those of you who fear impropriety: but if you abstain, it will be better for you. God is forgiving and compassionate"
