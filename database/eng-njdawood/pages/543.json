If three men confer in secret, He is their fourth; if five, He is their sixth; whether fewer or more, He is with them wherever they be.

When they come to you, they salute you in words which God does not greet you with, and ask themselves: ‘Why does God not punish us for what we say?‘ Hell is scourge enough for them: in its flames they shall burn, a wretched fate"
