They tamper with words out of their context and say: ‘If such-and-such be given you, accept it; if it be not given you, beware!‘ You cannot help a man if God intends to try him. Those whose hearts God does not intend to purify shall be held up to shame in this world, and in the world to come grievous punishment awaits them"
