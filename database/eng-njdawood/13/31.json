    "text": "And even if there be a Koran whereby the mountains could be set in motion, the earth rent asunder, and the dead communed with, surely all things are subject to God‘s will. Are the faithful unaware that, had God pleased, He could have guided all mankind? As for the unbelievers, because of their misdeeds disaster shall not cease to afflict them or to crouch at their very doorstep until God‘s promise be fulfilled. God will not fail the appointed time"
