    "text": "They do blaspheme, that say: ‘God is the Christ, the son of Mary.‘ For the Christ himself said: ‘Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.‘ He that worships other deities besides God, God will deny him Paradise, and his abode shall be the Fire. The wrongdoers shall have none to succour them"
