    "text": "Apostle, do not grieve for those who plunge headlong into unbelief; those who say with their mouths: ‘We believe,‘ but have no faith in their hearts, and those of the Jewish Faith who avidly listen to lies and avidly listen to others who have not come to you. They tamper with words out of their context and say: ‘If such-and-such be given you, accept it; if it be not given you, beware!‘ You cannot help a man if God intends to try him. Those whose hearts God does not intend to purify shall be held up to shame in this world, and in the world to come grievous punishment awaits them"
