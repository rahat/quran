    "text": "They do blaspheme, who declare: ‘God is Christ, the son of Mary.‘ Say: ‘Who could prevent God, if He so willed, from destroying Christ, the son of Mary, his mother, and all the people of the earth? God has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. He creates what He will; and God has power over all things.‘"
