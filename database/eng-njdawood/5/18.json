    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of God and His loved ones.‘ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins? Surely you are mortals of His own creation. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He pleases. God has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. All shall return to Him.‘"
