    "text": "Believers, you shall not kill game while on Pilgrimage. He that kills game by design, shall present, as an offering to the Kaâ€˜bah, an animal equivalent to the one he killed, to be determined by two just men among you; or he shall, in atonement, either feed the destitute or fast, so that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed. God has pardoned what is past; but if anyone relapses God will avenge Himself on him: God is Almighty and capable of revenge"
