    "text": "Believers, when death approaches you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses when you make your testament; or two men from another tribe if while you are traveling the land the calamity of death overtakes you. Detain them after prayers, and if you doubt their honesty, let them swear by God: ‘We will not sell our testimony for any price even to kin. We will not hide the testimony of God; for we should then be sinners.‘"
