    "text": "Then, after tribulation, He let peace fall upon you ― a sleep which overtook some among you, while others lay troubled by their own fancies, thinking unjust and foolish thoughts about God. ‘Have we any say in the matter?‘ they ask. Say: ‘All is in the hands of God.‘ They conceal in their minds what they do not reveal to you. They complain: ‘Had we had any say in the matter, we should not have been slain here.‘ Say: ‘Had you stayed in your homes, those of you who were destined to be slain would have died in their beds; for it was God‘s will to test what was in your bosoms and to scrutinize what was in your hearts. God has full knowledge of one‘s innermost thoughts.‘"
