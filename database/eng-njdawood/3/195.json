    "text": "Their Lord will answer them: ‘I will deny none among you, male or female, the reward of their labours. The one of you is as the other.‘ Those that fled their land and were expelled from their homes, and suffered persecution for My sake and fought and were slain: I shall surely acquit them of their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens watered by running brooks, as a recompense from God; God dispenses the richest recompense"
