    "text": "Believers, do not follow the example of the infidels, who say of their brothers when they meet death abroad or in battle: ‘Had they stayed with us they would not have died, nor would they have been killed.‘ God will turn that into a sigh in their hearts. God has power over life and death, and God is ever observant of what you do"
