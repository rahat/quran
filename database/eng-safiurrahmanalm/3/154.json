    "text": "Then after the distress, He sent down security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves and thought wrongly of Allah -- the thought of ignorance. They said, \"Have we any part in the affair\" Say: \"Indeed the affair belongs wholly to Allah.\" They hide within themselves what they dare not reveal to you, saying: \"If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,\" but that Allah might test what is in your breasts; and to purify that which was in your hearts (sins), and Allah is All-Knower of what is in the breasts"
