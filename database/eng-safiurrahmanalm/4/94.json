    "text": "O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: \"You are not a believer;\" seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There is much more benefit with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do"
