And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies, listening to others who have not come to you. They change the words from their places; they say, \"If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!\" And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Fitnah, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify; for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment"
