And (the period of) his gestation and the weaning of him is thirty months, till when he attains full strength and reaches forty years, he says: \"My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good.
