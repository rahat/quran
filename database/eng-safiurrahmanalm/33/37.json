    "text": "And (remember) when you said to him on whom Allah has bestowed grace and you have done a favor: \"Keep your wife to yourself, and have Taqwa of Allah.\" But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled"
