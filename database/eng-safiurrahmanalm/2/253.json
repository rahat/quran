We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honor); and to `Isa, the son of Maryam, We gave clear proofs and evidences, and supported him with Ruh-il-Qudus [Jibril]. If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed Ù€ some of them believed and others disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allah does what He wills"
