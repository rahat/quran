    "text": "Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord (Allah), because Allah had given him the kingdom When Ibrahim said (to him): \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim said, \"Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east; then bring it you from the west.\" So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allah guides not the people, who are wrongdoers"
