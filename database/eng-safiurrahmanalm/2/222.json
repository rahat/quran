    "text": "They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: \"That is an Adha, therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not in unto them till they are purified.\" And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you. Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves"
