    "text": "They ask you (O Muhammad) about the crescents. Say: \"These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.\" It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors, and have Taqwa of Allah that you may be successful"
