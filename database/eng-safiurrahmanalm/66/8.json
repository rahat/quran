It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow -- the Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run forward before them and in their right hands. They will say: \"Our Lord! Keep perfect our light for us and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things"
