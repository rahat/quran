    "text": "And when Musa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord (Allah) spoke to him; he said: \"O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You.\" Allah said: \"You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.\" So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers"
