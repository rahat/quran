    "text": "And We divided them into twelve tribes (as distinct) nations. We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for water (saying): \"Strike the stone with your stick,\" and there gushed forth out of it twelve springs, each group knew its own place for water. We shaded them with the clouds and sent down upon them the manna and the quail (saying): \"Eat of the good things with which We have provided you.\" They harmed Us not but they used to harm themselves"
