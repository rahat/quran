    "text": "And when Musa returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said: \"What an evil thing is that which you have done during my absence. Did you hasten in matter of your Lord\" And he threw down the Tablets and seized his brother by (the hair of) his head and dragged him towards him. He (Harun) said: \"O son of my mother! Indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me, so make not the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me among the people who are wrongdoers"
