    "text": "And the Jews and the Christians say: \"We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.\" Say: \"Why then does He punish you for your sins\" Nay, you are but human beings of those He has created, He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; and to Him is the return (of all)"
