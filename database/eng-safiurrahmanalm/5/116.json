Did you say unto men: `Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah\"' He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Yours, truly, You, only You, are the Knower of all that is hidden and unseen"
