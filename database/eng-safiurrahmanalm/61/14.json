    "text": "O you who believe! Be you helpers (in the cause) of Allah as said `Isa, son of Maryam, to the Hawariyyin (the disciples): \"Who are my helpers (in the cause) of Allah\" The Hawariyyun said: \"We are Allah's helpers\" (i.e., we will strive in His cause!). Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So, We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the victorious (uppermost)"
