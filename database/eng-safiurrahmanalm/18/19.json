A speaker among them said: \"How long have you stayed (here)\" They said: \"We have stayed a day or part of a day.\" They said: \"Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed (here). So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town, and let him find out which is the Azka food, and bring some of that to you. And let him be careful and let no man know of you"
