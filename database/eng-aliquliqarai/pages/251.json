Say, ‘Allah is the creator of all things, and He is the One and the All-paramount.’"

And from what they smelt in the fire for the purpose of [making] ornaments or wares, [there arises] a similar scum. That is how Allah compares truth and falsehood. As for the scum, it leaves as dross, and that which profits the people stays in the earth. That is how Allah draws comparisons"

For such there shall be an adverse reckoning, and their refuge shall be hell, and it is an evil resting place"
