    "text": "O you who have faith! Should any of you desert his religion, Allah will soon bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, [who will be] humble towards the faithful, stern towards the faithless, waging jihad in the way of Allah, not fearing the blame of any blamer. That is Allahâ€™s grace, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is all-bounteous, all-knowing"
