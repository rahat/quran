    "text": "Know that the life of this world is mere diversion and play, glamour and mutual vainglory among you and rivalry for wealth and childrenâ€”like rain, whose growth impresses the farmer. Then it withers and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes chaff. Whereas in the Hereafter there is forgiveness from Allah and His approval and a severe punishment. The life of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion"
