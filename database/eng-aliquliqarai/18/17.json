    "text": "You may see the sun, when it rises, slanting toward the right of their cave, and, when it sets, cut across them towards the left, and they are in a cavern within it. That is one of Allahâ€™s signs. Whomever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whomever He leads astray, you will never find for him any guardian or guide"
