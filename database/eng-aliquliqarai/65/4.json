    "text": "As for those of your wives who have ceased having menses—[or] if you have any doubts [concerning its cause, whether it’s is age or something else]—their term [of waiting] and of those who have not yet had menses, shall be three months. As for those who are pregnant, their term shall be until they deliver. And whoever is wary of Allah, He shall grant him ease in his affairs"
