And if Allah had so wiled it, those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear proofs had come unto them. But they differed, some of them believing and some disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with another; but Allah doeth what He will"

His throne includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous"
