And those women whom you enjoy thereby, give unto them their bridewealth, as an obligation; but there is no blame on you for what you agree to after the obligation. God is Knowing, Wise"

And when they are married, should they commit an indecency, they shall be liable to half the punishment of free women. This is for the one among you who fears he will sin, but it is better for you to be patient. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
