    "text": "Has not the account come to you of those who came before you—the people of Noah, and ?Ad, and Thamud, and those who came after them? None knows them but God. Their messengers brought them clear proofs, but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said, “Verily we disbelieve in that wherewith you have been sent, and we are in grave doubt about that to which you call us.”"
