    "text": "The Bedouin who stayed behind will say to thee, “We were occupied by our property and our families; so ask forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say, “Who can avail you aught from God should He desire harm for you or should He desire benefit for you? Nay, but God is Aware of whatsoever you do"
