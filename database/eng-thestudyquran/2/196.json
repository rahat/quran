    "text": "Complete the ?ajj and ?umrah for God, and if you are hindered, then [make] such offering as is easy. And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its place of sacrifice. But whosoever among you is ill or has an ailment of his head, then [let there be] a ransom by fasting, charity, or rite. When you are safe, let those who enjoy the ?umrah ahead of the ?ajj [make] such offering as is easy. Whosoever finds not [the means], let him fast three days during the ?ajj, and seven when you return. That is ten altogether. This is for those whose family dwells not near the Sacred Mosque. And reverence God, and know that God is severe in retribution"
