    "text": "Or [think of] the like of him who passed by a town as it lay fallen upon its roofs. He said, “How shall God give life to this after its death?” So God caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up. He said, “How long hast thou tarried?” He said, “I tarried a day or part of a day.” He said, “Nay, thou hast tarried a hundred years. Look, then, at thy food and thy drink—they have not spoiled. And look at thy donkey. And [this was done] that We may make thee a sign for mankind. And look at the bones, how We set them up, then clothe them with flesh.” When it became clear to him he said, “I know that God has power over all things.”"
