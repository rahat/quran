    "text": "Were there a Quran whereby the mountains were set in motion, or the earth was cleft, or the dead were made to speak! Nay! Unto God belongs the affair altogether. Do not those who believe understand that if God had willed, He would have guided mankind all together? And those who disbelieve, calamity will never cease to befall them because of that which they have wrought, or to alight close to their abode until Godâ€™s Promise comes. Truly God will not fail the tryst"
