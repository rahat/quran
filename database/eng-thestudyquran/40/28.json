    "text": "And a believing man from the House of Pharaoh who was concealing his belief said, “Will you kill a man for saying, ‘My Lord is God,’ though he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, then his lying is to his own detriment. But if he is truthful, some of that which he promises you will befall you. Truly God guides not one who is a prodigal liar"
