    "text": "Truly those who believe, and migrate, and strive with their wealth and themselves in the way of God, and those who sheltered and helpedâ€”they are protectors of one another. As for those who believe and did not migrate, you owe them no protection until they migrate. But if they ask your help for the sake of religion, then help is a duty upon you, except against a people with whom you have a covenant. And God sees whatsoever you do"
