    "text": "Hast thou not seen those who were forbidden from secretly conversing then returned to that which they had been forbidden, secretly conversing with a view to sin, enmity, and disobeying the Messenger? And when they come to thee and greet thee, they greet thee in a manner that God has not greeted thee and say within themselves, “Why does God not punish us for what we say?” Hell suffices them, burning therein. What an evil journey’s end"
