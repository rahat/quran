    "text": "Hast thou not considered that God knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no secret converse among three, but that He is their fourth, nor among five, but that He is their sixth, nor less than that, nor more, but that He is with them wheresoever they are. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of that which they did. Truly God is Knower of all things"
