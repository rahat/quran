    "text": "You shall not find a people who believe in God and the Last Day loving those who oppose God and His Messenger, even if they be their fathers, their sons, their brothers, or their tribe. God has inscribed faith upon their hearts and strengthened them with a Spirit from Him. He causes them to enter Gardens with rivers running below, to abide therein, God being content with them and they being content with Him. They are the party of God. Truly the party of Godâ€”it is they who shall prosper"
