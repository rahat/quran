Take not Mine enemy and your enemy as friends—you offer them affection, though they have indeed disbelieved in the truth that has come to you, expelling the Messenger and you for having believed in God your Lord—if you have gone forth striving in My way and seeking My good pleasure. You show them affection in secret, while I know best that which you hide and that which you disclose. And whosoever among you does so has indeed strayed from the right way"

We have rejected you, and enmity and hatred have arisen between us and you forever, till you believe in God alone”; save for Abraham’s saying to his father, “I shall assuredly ask forgiveness for you, though I have no power to avail you aught from God.” “Our Lord, in Thee do we trust, unto Thee do we turn in repentance, and unto Thee is the journey’s end"
