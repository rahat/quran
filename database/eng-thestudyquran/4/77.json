    "text": "Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said, “Restrain your hands, and perform the prayer, and give the alms.” But when fighting was prescribed for them, behold, a party of them feared men, even as they should have feared God, or with greater fear, and they said, “Our Lord! Why hast Thou prescribed fighting for us? If only Thou wouldst grant us reprieve for a term nigh.” Say, “Scant is the enjoyment of this world, and the Hereafter is better for those who are reverent, and you shall not be wronged so much as the thread of a date stone.”"
