    "text": "And We have appointed none but angels as wardens of the Fire; and We have not appointed their number save as a trial for those who disbelieve, to grant certainty to those who have been given the Book and increase in faith those who believe; and that those who were given the Book and the believers will not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers will say, “What does God desire by this as a parable?” Thus does God lead astray whomsoever He will and guide whomsoever He will. And none knows the hosts of thy Lord but He. It is but a reminder for the human being"
