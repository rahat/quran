And the supplication of the disbelievers is naught but astray"

Say, “God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Paramount.”"

But those who answer Him not—were they to possess all that is on the earth and the like of it besides, they would seek to ransom themselves thereby. For them there shall be an evil reckoning. Their refuge is Hell. What an evil resting place"
