Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [their husbandsâ€™] absence what God has guarded. As for those from whom you fear discord and animosity, admonish them, then leave them in their beds, then strike them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Truly God is Exalted, Great"
