Then if you know them to be believers, do not return them to the disbelievers. Those women are not lawful for those men; nor are those men lawful for those women. And give them what they have spent. There is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their bridewealth. And hold not to the ties of disbelieving women. Ask for what you have spent, and let them ask for what they have spent. That is the Judgment of God; He judges between you. And God is Knowing, Wise"
