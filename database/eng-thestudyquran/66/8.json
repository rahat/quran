    "text": "O you who believe! Repent unto God with sincere repentance. It may be that your Lord will absolve you of your evil deeds and cause you to enter Gardens with rivers running below—the Day when God will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him, with their light spreading before them and on their right, while they say, “Our Lord, complete our light for us and forgive us. Truly Thou art Powerful over all things.”"
