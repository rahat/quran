    "text": "And [remember] when thou said unto him whom God has blessed and whom thou hast blessed, “Retain your wife for yourself and reverence God,” thou wast hiding in thyself that which God was to disclose; and thou didst fear the people, though God has more right to be feared by thee. Then when Zayd relinquished his claim upon her, We wed her to thee, so that there should be no restriction for the believers in respect to the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have relinquished their claims upon them. And the Command of God shall be fulfilled"
