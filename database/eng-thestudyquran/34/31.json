    "text": "The disbelievers say, “We shall not believe in this Quran, nor in that which was before it.” Couldst thou but see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, hurling reproach upon one another! Those who had been weak and oppressed will say to those who had waxed arrogant, “If not for you, we would have been believers.”"
