    "text": "Know that the life of this world is but play, diversion, ornament, mutual boasting among you, and vying for increase in property and childrenâ€”the likeness of a rain whose vegetation impresses the farmers; then it withers such that you see it turn yellow; then it becomes chaff. And in the Hereafter there shall be severe punishment, forgiveness from God, and contentment, and the life of this world is naught but the enjoyment of delusion"
