    "text": "And when harm befalls man, he calls upon his Lord, turning unto Him. Then when He bestows a blessing from Himself upon him, he forgets the One upon whom he called before and sets up equals unto God to lead astray from His path. Say, “Enjoy your disbelief a little; truly you shall be among the inhabitants of the Fire.”"
