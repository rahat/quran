    "text": "They shall be struck with abasement wherever they are come upon, save by means of a rope from God and a rope from mankind. And they shall earn a burden of wrath from God, and they shall be struck with indigence. That is because they used to disbelieve in Godâ€™s signs and kill the prophets without right. That is for their having disobeyed and transgressed"
