    "text": "O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they travel upon the earth or campaign, “Had they stayed with us, they would not have died and been slain,” that God may make that a source of regret in their hearts. And God gives life and causes death, and God sees whatsoever you do"
