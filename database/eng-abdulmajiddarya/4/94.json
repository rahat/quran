    "text": "O Ye who believe! when ye march forth in the way of Allah, make things clear and say not unto one who giveth you a salutation: thou art none of a believer, seeking the perishable goods of the life of the world; for with Allah are spoils abundant. Even Thus were ye aforetime, then Allah favoured you. So make things clear; verily Allah is of that which ye work ever Aware"
