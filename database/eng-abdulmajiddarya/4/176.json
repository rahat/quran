Say thou: Allah pronounceth thus in the matter of one without father or child: if a person perisheth and hath no child, but hath a sister, hers shall be the half of that which he hath left: and he shall be her heir if she hath no child, if there be two sisters, then theirs shall be two-third of that which he hath left; and if there be both brothers and sisters, then male shall have as much as the portion of two females. Allah expoundeth unto you, lest ye err; and Allah is of everything Knower"
