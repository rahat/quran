    "text": "And let those alone who have taken their religion as a play and a sport and whom the life of the world hath beguiled. And admonish thou them therewith lest a soul be given up to perdition for that which it hath earned, when for him there shall be no friend or intercessor beside Allah, and when if he offer every equivalent it shall not be accepted of him. Those are they who are given up to perdition for that which they have earned. For them shall be drink of boiling water and a torment afflictive, for they were wont to disbelieve"
