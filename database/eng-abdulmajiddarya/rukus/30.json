And it is not allowed unto you to take away aught ye have given them, except the twain fear that they may not observe the bonds of Allah. If yes fear that the twain may not observe the bonds of Allah, then no blame is on the twain for that where with she ransometh herself. These are the bonds of Allah, wherefore trespass them not; and whosoever trespasseth the bonds of Allah, then verily these! they are the wrong-doers"
