    "text": "And recall what time thou wast saying unto him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou hadst conferred favour: keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah; so and thou wast concealing in thy mind that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing mankind, whereas Allah had a better right that Him thou shouldst fear. Then when Zaid had performed his purpose concerning her, We wedded her to thee, that there should be no blame for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when they have performed their purpose concerning them. And the ordinance of Allah was to be fulfilled"
