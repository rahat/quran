    "text": "And the divorced women shall keep themselves in waiting for three courses nor is it allowed unto them that they should hide that which Allah hath created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands are more entitled to their restorations during the same, if they desire rectification. Unto women is due likes that which is due from women reputably. And for men is a degree over them. And Allah is Mighty, Wise"
