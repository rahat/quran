    "text": "Allah tasketh not a soul except according to its capacity. For it shall be the good it earnoth, and against it the evil it earnoth. Our Lord! reckon with not if we forget or er. Our Lord! ray not on us a burthen like unto that which Thou laidest on those before us, Our Lord! impose not on US that for which we have not strength. And Pardon us; forgive US; and have mercy on us; Thou art our Patron: so make US triumph over the disbelieving people"
