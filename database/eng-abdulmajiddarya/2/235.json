Allah knoweth that ye will anon make mention of these women: but make no promises unto them in secret, except ye speak a reputable saying. And even resolve not on wedding-knot until the prescribed term hath attained its end; and know that Allah knoweth that which is in your souls, wherefore beware of Him, and know that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"
