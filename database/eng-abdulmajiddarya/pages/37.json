And hold not Allah's commandments in mockery and remember Allah's favour upon you, and that he hath sent down unto you the Book and the wisdom wherewith He exhorted you; and fear Allah, and know that verily Allah is of everything the Knower"

Neither shall a mother be hurt because of her child, nor shall he to whom the child is born because of his Child; and on the heir shall devolve the like thereof. Then if the twain desire weaning by agreement between them and mutual counsel, on the twain is no blame. And if ye desire to give your children out for suckling, On you is no blame when ye hand over that which ye had agreed to give her reputably. And fear Allah, and know that of that which ye work Allah is the Beholder"
