            "text": "O ye who believe! when ye deal, one with anot her, in lending for a term named, write it down, and let a scribe write it down justly between you, and let not the scribe refuse to write according as Allah hath taught him. Let him write them, and let him who oweth dictate, and let him fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish not aught thereof. But if he who oweth be witless or infirm or unable himself to dictate, then let his guardian dictate justly. And call to witness two witnesses of your men, but if both be not men, then a man and two women of those ye agree upon as witnesses, so that if one of the twain err, the one thereof shall remind the other: and let not the witnesses refuse When they are called on And be not Weary of writing it down, be it small or big, with the term thereof. This is the most equitable in the sight of Allah and the most confirmatory of testimony and nearest that ye may not doubt, except when it be a ready merchandise that ye circulate between you, for then there Shall be no blame on you if ye write it not down. And call witnesses when ye bargain With one anot her; and let not the scribe eome to harm nor the witness; and if ye do, verily it will be wickedness in you. Fear Allah; and Allah teacheth you Knower; and Allah is of everything Knower"
