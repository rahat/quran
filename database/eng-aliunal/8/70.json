Say to the captives in your hands: \"If God knows any good in your hearts (any readiness to believe in and surrender to God), He will grant you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you.\" God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate (especially towards His servants who return to Him in repentance)"
