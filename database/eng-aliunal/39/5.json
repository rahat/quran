    "text": "He has created the heavens and the earth with truth (meaningfully and for definite purpose, and on solid foundations of truth). He wraps the night around the day and He wraps the day around the night (until one covers the other completely). And He has made the sun and the moon subservient (to His command), each running its course for a term appointed (by Him). Be aware! He is the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish those who oppose Him), the All-Forgiving (Who forgives those who turn to Him in repentance)"
