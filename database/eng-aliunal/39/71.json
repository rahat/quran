Until when they arrive there, its doors will immediately be opened and its keepers will ask them: \"Did there not come to you Messengers from among you, reciting to you the Revelations of your Lord and warning you of this Day that you were to encounter?\" They will answer: \"Yes, indeed!\" But the word of (Godâ€™s) punishment upon the unbelievers is fulfilled"
