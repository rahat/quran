Say: \"I ask of you no wage for it (for conveying Godâ€™s Religion to you which will bring you this favor), but (I ask of you for) love for my near relatives (on account of my mission).\" Whoever scores a good deed, We increase him in good in respect of it. Surely God is All-Forgiving, All-Responsive (to gratitude)"
