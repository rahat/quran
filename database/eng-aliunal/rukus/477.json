Thereafter He will make them truly understand all that they do (and call them to account) on the Day of Resurrection. Surely God has full knowledge of everything"

(It is these very people who) when they come to you, salute you with a salutation that God has never taught you and with which He has never saluted you, and say to one another (in derision): \"Why does God not punish us for what we say (if Muhammad is truly His Prophet)?\" Hell will suffice them, they will enter it to roast.
