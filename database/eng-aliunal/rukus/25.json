Say: \"They are appointed times (markers) for the people (to determine time periods) and for the Pilgrimage.\" (Do not link them to superstitions and superstitious behavior like entering dwellings by the back rather than the front.) It is not virtue that you enter dwellings from the backs of them, but virtue is (the state of) one who (truly believing in God) strives to attain righteousness and piety (by carrying out His commandments and refraining from His prohibitions). So come to dwellings (in the normal way) by their doors. (Do everything according to the rule and establish relations with your leader and among yourselves in proper terms.) And strive to obey God in due reverence for Him and piety so that you may prosper"

For whoever cannot afford the offering, a fast for three days during the Hajj, and for seven days when you return home, that is, ten days in all.
