God said: \"Surely I am with you: if indeed you establish the Prayer in conformity with all its conditions, and pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms, and believe in all of My Messengers, and honor and support them, and lend God a good loan (by spending out of your wealth in God’s cause), I will surely blot out from you your evil deeds and will certainly admit you into Gardens through which rivers flow. But whoever among you disbelieves after this and is ungrateful has surely strayed from the right, even way"

You will not cease to light upon some act of treachery from them, except a few of them. Yet pardon them, and overlook (their misdeeds).
