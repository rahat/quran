But they drank thereof, all save a few of them; and when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, (those who, with weak faith, took of the river in the hollow of their hands) said: \"Today we have no power against Goliath and his forces.\" But those who had certainty of their meeting with God and felt as if always standing in His Presence said: \"Many a small company has overcome a numerous company by God’s leave.\" God is with the patient and persevering"

Yet had God so willed, they would not have fought one against the other, but God does whatever He wills"
