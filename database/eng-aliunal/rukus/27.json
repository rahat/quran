And only those who were given it differed concerning it, after the most manifest truths came to them, because of envious rivalry and insolence among themselves. God has guided by His leave those who have believed (in the Book and the Prophets, those who now believe in the Qur’an and Muhammad) to the truth about that on which they were differing. God guides whomever He wills to a straight path"
