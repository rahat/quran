Say: \"It is a state of hurt (and ritual impurity), so keep away from them during their menstruation and do not approach them until they are cleansed. When they are cleansed, then (you can) go to them inasmuch as God has commanded you (according to the urge He has placed in your nature and within the terms He has enjoined upon you). Surely God loves those who turn to Him in sincere repentance (of past sins and errors) and He loves those who cleanse themselves"
