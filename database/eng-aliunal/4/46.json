    "text": "Among those who have become Jews (Judaized) are some who alter the words from their context to distort their meanings, and say: \"We have heard and we disobey,\" and, \"Do hear us, may you turn dumb,\" (while pretending to say: \"Will you hearken to us, O respected one!\"), and \"Listen to us! May you become deaf, O shepherd!\" (while pretending to say: \"Attend to us!\") â€“ thus making a malicious play with their tongues and seeking to revile the (True) Religion. Had they but said, \"We have heard and we obey,\" and \"Listen to us,\" and \"Favor us with your attention!\", it would indeed have been for their own good, and more upright. But God has excluded them from His mercy because of their (willful, persistent) unbelief, and, but for a few, scarcely do they believe"
