    "text": "Assuredly God does not forgive that partners be associated with Him; less than that He forgives to whomever He wills (whomever He has guided to repentance and righteousness either out of His pure grace or as a result of the personâ€™s choosing repentance and righteousness by his free will). Whoever associates any partner with God has indeed fabricated a most heinous sin"
