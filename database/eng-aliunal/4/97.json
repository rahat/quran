    "text": "As to those whose souls the angels (charged with taking the souls of people) take in the state of wronging themselves (by continuing to live in unbelief without suffering to emigrate to a land where they would be able to attain faith): They (the angels) ask them: \"What situation were you in (so that you were not with the believers)?\" They say: \"We were under such oppression in this land that we could not find way to faith.\" They (the angels) say: \"Was Godâ€™s earth not wide enough for you to emigrate in it?\" Such are those whose refuge is Hell: how evil a destination to arrive at"
