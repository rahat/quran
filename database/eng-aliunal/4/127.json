    "text": "(O Messenger!) They ask you to pronounce laws concerning women. Answer them: \"God pronounces to you the laws concerning them and it is recited to you in this Book concerning female orphans, to whom you do not give what has been ordained for them (as bridal-due or for their maintenance), and yet desire to marry them (out of greed to get their charms or wealth for yourself, or by refusing to let them marry to continue benefiting from their wealth); and also concerning the weak, helpless children (whose rights should be protected), and that you must be assiduous in observing the rights of orphans.\" Whatever good you do â€“ surely God has full knowledge of it"
