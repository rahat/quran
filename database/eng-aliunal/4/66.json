    "text": "If We were to ordain for them, \"Lay down your lives (in God’s cause so that you may be purified of your sins)\" or \"Leave your habitations (that you have contaminated with your sins and emigrate to another land in God’s cause),\" they would not do that save a few of them. But if they had done what was urged upon them (before things had come to this point) – if only they would do it from now on – it would indeed have been (and would be) for their own good and (more apt for them) to be more securely established (in the land)"
