    "text": "Those who avoid the major sins and indecent, shameful deeds (which are in fact included in the major sins), only falling into small fault, â€“ surely your Lord is of extensive forgiveness. He knows you well when He originates you from (the particles of) earth, and when you are hidden (fetuses) in the wombs of your mothers. So do not hold yourselves pure (sinless; it is vain self-justification). He knows best him who keeps from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety"
