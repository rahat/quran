So whoever disbelieves (in ingratitude, rejecting this truth and attributing Godâ€™s deeds to others than Him), his unbelief is charged against him. The unbelief of the unbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their Lord in anything but abhorrence; and the unbelief of the unbelievers does not increase them in anything but loss"
