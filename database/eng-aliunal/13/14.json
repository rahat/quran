Those to whom they invoke and call others (to invoke), apart from Him, cannot answer them in any way â€“ (so that he who invokes them is but) like one who stretches out his hands to water (praying) that it may come to his mouth, but it never comes to it. The prayer of the unbelievers is but destined to go to waste"
