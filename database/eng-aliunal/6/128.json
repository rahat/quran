    "text": "On the day when He will raise to life and gather them (jinn and humankind, believers and unbelievers) all together, (He says): \"O you assembly of the jinn! You have seduced a good many of humankind (and included them in your company).\" Their closest fellows from among humankind will (confess and) say: \"Our Lord! We enjoyed one another (in self-interested fellowship, serving one another’s selfish ends), and now we have reached the end of our term that You appointed for us.\" He (God) will say: \"The Fire is now your dwelling to abide therein – God decrees however He wills.\" Indeed your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing (Whose every decree and act are based on absolute wisdom and knowledge)"
