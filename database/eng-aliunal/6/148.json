    "text": "Those who persist in associating partners with God will say: \"Had God willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated partners with Him, nor would we have declared anything (which God has made lawful) unlawful.\" Even so did those who lived before them deny (their Prophets with similar false excuses) until they tasted Our mighty punishment. Say (to them): \"Do you have any sound, authoritative knowledge (to support your claim)? (If you have) then bring it out for us! In fact you follow only conjecture, and you yourselves are only making false surmises (you pronounce judgments and act only according to your fancies, interests and personal value judgments)"
