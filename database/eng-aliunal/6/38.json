    "text": "(Should not those whose ears are closed to the Qur’an look around themselves to see the signs of the truth?) No living creature is there moving on the earth, no bird flying on its two wings, but they are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book (the Qur’an, the Supreme Preserved Tablet, which is the source of all books, and the Book of Creation: We have created everything just in its place and for a purpose, so that the universe is maintained in perfect balance and order). Then, (a Day will come when the universe will be changed into a new one, and) they will be raised from the dead and gathered to their Lord"
