    "text": "And do not (in the hope of persuading the chieftains of the unbelievers) drive away any of those (poor believers of humble social standing) who, in the morning and afternoon, invoke their Lord, seeking His \"Face\" (i.e. the meeting with Him hereafter and His eternal, good pleasure). You are not accountable for them in anything just as they are not accountable for you in anything, that you should drive them away, and so become among the wrongdoers"
