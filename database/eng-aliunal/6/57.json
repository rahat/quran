Not within my power is what you (deridingly) ask to be hastened, (saying: ‘If there is a punishment with which you threaten us, let it come immediately’). (In the absolute sense) judgment and authority rest with none but God alone. He always relates the truth, and He is the best judge between truth and falsehood"
