    "text": "(One day he left the palace where he was living and) he entered the city at a time when he was unnoticed by its people, and found therein two men fighting, one of his own people and the other of their enemies (the native Copts). The one from his people called on him for help against the other, who was from their enemies. So Moses struck him with his hand and caused his death (unintentionally). He said: \"This (enmity and fighting) is of Satanâ€™s doing. Surely he is manifestly a misleading enemy"
