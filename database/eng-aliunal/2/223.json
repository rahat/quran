    "text": "Your women are like a tilth for you (where you plant seed to obtain produce) so come to your tilth as you wish, and send ahead (good issue) for (the future of) your souls. Act in due reverence for God, keeping within the bounds of piety and obedience to Him (both in your relations with your women and bringing up offspring, as in all other matters). And know that you are to meet with Him; and give glad tidings to the believers (of what they will find in His Presence)"
