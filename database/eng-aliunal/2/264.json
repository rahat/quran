    "text": "O you who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by putting (the receiver) under an obligation and taunting â€“ like him who spends his wealth to show off to people and be praised by them, and believes not in God and the Last Day. The parable of his spending is that of a rock on which there is soil; a heavy rain falls upon it, and leaves it barren. They have no power (control) over what they have earned. God guides not such disbelieving people (to attain their goals)"
