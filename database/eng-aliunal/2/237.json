    "text": "If you divorce them before you have touched them but have already appointed for them a marriage-portion, then (give them) half of what you appointed, unless they make remission and forgo it or he in whose hand the marriage tie is makes remission (and pays the full amount). If you make remission, this is nearer and more suited to piety, and do not forget magnanimity among yourselves. Whatever you do, surely God sees it well"
