    "text": "(Despite all such favors, affection, forgiveness, advice and truths, they refuse to believe, and by way of excuse they ask derisively: \"Do we need any of what you have to tell?\" Recognizing that what they are told has no effect on them) they say: \"Our hearts have become covered (callous, no longer having any ability to believe).\" No! Rather, because of their unbelief God has cursed them (excluded them from His mercy and set a seal on their hearts and hearing and a veil on their eyes.) So, little do they believe (or can admit of the truth)"
