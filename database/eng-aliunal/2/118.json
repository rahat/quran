    "text": "Those who have no knowledge (from Him, those who do not recognize God, and therefore lead an ignorant life) say: \"Why does not God speak to us (directly) or a manifest sign (a miracle) come to us?\" So spoke those before them, a word like theirs. Their hearts are alike. Yet We have made clear the signs (the Revelations establishing the Unity and Sovereignty of God, the Messengership of Muhammad, and the Divine authorship of the Qurâ€™an,) to a people who seek certainty (with open, inquiring minds)"
