    "text": "And in that way (O Community of Muhammad! whereas others turn in different directions and, straying from the Straight Path, falter between extremes in thought and belief) We have made you a middle-way community, that you may be witnesses for the people (as to the ways they follow), and that the (most noble) Messenger may be a witness for you. We formerly appointed (the Bayt al-Maqdis in Jerusalem) the direction to turn in the Prayer (and now are about to change it) so that We may determine who truly follows the Messenger from him who turns back on his heels (when the Messengerâ€™s way does not suit his desires). And indeed that testing was burdensome, save for those whom God has guided (and made steadfast in faith). God will never let your faith go to waste. Surely God is for the people All-Pitying, All-Compassionate"
