    "text": "(Just retaliation, as well as war or other defensive measures to maintain your existence, are not possible without expense. So) spend in Godâ€™s cause (out of whatever you have) and do not ruin yourselves by your own hands (by refraining from spending. Whatever you do,) do it in the best way in the awareness that God sees it. Surely God loves those who are devoted to doing good, aware that God is seeing them"
