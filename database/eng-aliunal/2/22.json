    "text": "And Who has made the earth a bed (comfortable, couch-like floor) for you, and the sky a canopy. He sends down from the sky water, with which He brings forth fruits for your provision. So do not set up rivals to God (as deities, lords and objects of worship) when you know (that there can be no deities, lords, creators and providers at all to worship save God)"
