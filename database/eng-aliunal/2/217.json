    "text": "They ask you about the Sacred Month and fighting in it. Say: \"Fighting in it is a grave sin; but barring people from the way of God, unbelief in Him, and denying entry into the Sacred Mosque, and expelling its inmates from it are far graver and more sinful in the sight of God; disorder (rooted in rebellion to God and recognizing no laws) is even far graver and more sinful than killing. And they will not cease fighting against you until they turn you from your religion, if they can. Whoever of you turns away from his religion and dies an unbeliever â€“ those are they whose works have been wasted in both the world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein"
