    "text": "Those who conceal the truths and commandments in the Book that God has sent down, and sell them for a trifling price (such as worldly benefit, status and renown), they eat nothing but fire in their bellies. And God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection (when they will be in dire need to speak to Him to implore forgiveness and mercy), nor will He absolve them to pronounce them pure. For them is a painful punishment"
