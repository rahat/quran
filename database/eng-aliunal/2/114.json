    "text": "Who is greater in doing wrong than he who bars Godâ€™s places of worship, so that His Name be not mentioned and invoked in them, and strives to ruin them? Such people might never enter them, save in fear (whether because of their alienation from the Religion or because they try to destroy them owing to their animosity against God). For them is disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter a tremendous punishment"
