    "text": "And (remember the time) when you said: \"Moses, we will no longer be able to endure one sort of food. Pray for us to your Lord, that He may bring forth for us of all that the soil produces â€“ its green herbs, and its cucumbers, and its corn, and its lentils, and its onions.\" He (Moses) responded: \"Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt (or some city); surely there is for you there what you ask for.\" So in the end ignominy and misery were pitched upon them, and they earned wrath (a humiliating punishment) from God. That was because they were persistently disbelieving in Our Revelations and rejecting Our signs (despite continuously observing them in their lives), and killing the Prophets against all right and truth. That was because they disobeyed and kept on exceeding the bounds (of the Law)"
