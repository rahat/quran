    "text": "And (remember) when We took a promise from the Children of Israel: You shall worship none save God (as the only Deity, Lord and Sovereign), and do good to parents in the best way possible, and to the near (relatives), to the orphans, and to the destitute; and speak kindly and well to the people; and establish the Prayer, and pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms. But then you turned away in aversion, all except a few of you; in fact you are a people always avoiding your compacts and responsibilities"
