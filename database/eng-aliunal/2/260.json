    "text": "And recall when Abraham said: \"My Lord, show me how You will restore life to the dead!\" God said: \"Why? Do you not believe?\" Abraham said: \"Yes, but that my heart may be at rest.\" He (his Lord) said: \"Then take four of the birds (of different kinds), and tame them to yourself to know them fully.
