    "text": "And (remember) when We took your promise (to keep Our covenant) and (in order to stress the importance of both the covenant and keeping it, and warn you against breaking it) We raised the Mount (and caused it to tower) above you: Hold firmly to what We haven given you (of the Book) and give ear (to Our commandments and obey Moses.) They replied: \"We give ear,\" (but by doing the opposite of what they were commanded, they meant) \"we disobey.\" Because of their unbelief, they were made to drink into their hearts (love of) the calf (with then no place left therein for faith). Say (to them): \"How evil is that which your belief enjoins on you, if you are believers"
