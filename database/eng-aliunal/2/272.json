    "text": "(O Messenger! Your mission is to communicate all such commandments, so) it is not your duty to secure their guidance (in every matter); but God guides whomever He wills. (O people,) whatever good you spend (in charity and other good causes) is to your own benefit, and (as believers) you do not spend but in search of Godâ€™s \"Face\" (seeking to be worthy of His favor). Whatever good you spend will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged"
