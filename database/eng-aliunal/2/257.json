    "text": "God is the confidant and guardian of those who believe (to Whom they can entrust their affairs and on Whom they can rely), bringing them out from all kinds of (intellectual, spiritual, social, economic and political) darkness into the light, and keeping them firm therein. And those who disbelieve, their confidants and guardians are the taghut (authorities who rule and devise false religions and systems in defiance of God); bringing them out from the light into all kinds of darkness. Those are companions of the Fire; and they will abide therein"
