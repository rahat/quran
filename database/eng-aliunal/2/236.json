    "text": "There is no blame on you if you divorce women (with whom you made a marriage contract,) while as yet you have not touched them nor appointed any marriage-portion for them. Yet, make some provision for them, the affluent according to his means, and the straitened according to his means â€“ a provision according to customary good and religiously approvable practice, as a duty upon those devoted to doing good, aware that God is seeing them"
