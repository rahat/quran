    "text": "Humankind were (in the beginning) one community (following one way of life without disputing over provision and other similar things. Later on differences arose and) God sent Prophets as bearers of glad tidings (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) and warners (against the consequences of straying and transgression), and He sent down with them the Book with the truth (containing nothing false in it) so that it might judge between the people concerning that on which they were differing. And only those who were given it differed concerning it, after the most manifest truths came to them, because of envious rivalry and insolence among themselves. God has guided by His leave those who have believed (in the Book and the Prophets, those who now believe in the Qurâ€™an and Muhammad) to the truth about that on which they were differing. God guides whomever He wills to a straight path"
