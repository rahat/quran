    "text": "God does not disdain to strike any parable â€“ (that of) something like a gnat or something greater or lower than it. Those who have already believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. As to those whose unbelief has long been established in their hearts, they say, \"What does God mean by such a parable?\" Thereby He leads many astray, and thereby He guides many. He thereby leads none astray save the transgressors"
