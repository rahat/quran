    "text": "Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day (with their periods shortening and lengthening), and the vessels sailing in the sea with profit to people, and the water that God sends down from the sky, therewith reviving the earth after its death and dispersing therein all kinds of living creatures, and His disposal of the winds, and the clouds subservient between sky and earth â€“ surely there are signs (demonstrating that He is the One God deserving worship, and the sole Refuge and Helper) for a people who use their reason"
