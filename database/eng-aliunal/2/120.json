Say (to them, O Messenger): \"God’s guidance (represented by the Qur’an) is the true guidance.\" If (supposing the impossible) you were to follow their desires and fancies after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have against God neither a guardian (who can protect you from His punishment) nor a helper"
