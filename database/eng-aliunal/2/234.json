    "text": "Those among you who die, leaving behind their wives: they (the wives) shall keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days, (during which they should refrain from marrying and from self-adornment with a view to presenting themselves for marriage). When they have reached the end of the waiting term, then there is no blame on you for what they may do by themselves within (the bounds of) decency. God is fully aware of all that you do"
