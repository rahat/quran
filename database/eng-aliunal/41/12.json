    "text": "So He fashioned them (the clouds of gaseous elements which then existed in the place of the heaven) seven heavens in two days and inspired in each heaven its tasks. And We adorned the lowest heaven (the heaven of the world) with lamps (stars), and guard (against every satan who would attempt to steal away information of the Unseen from angels).
