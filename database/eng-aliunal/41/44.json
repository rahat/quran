    "text": "If We had made it a Qurâ€™an in a foreign tongue, they (who now reject it) would certainly have said: \"If only its communications had been spelled out distinctly and made clear! Why a foreign tongue, and an Arab (to speak it to Arabs)?\" Say: \"(It is not a Book whose power or purpose is confined by language.) For those who believe, it is a guidance and healing (for their hearts and minds, and all their senses). But as for those who do not believe, in their ears is heaviness, and it is imperceptible to them. They are (like people who are being) called from far off (so the call does not reach their hearing and sight)"
