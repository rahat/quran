    "text": "He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He established Himself on the Throne. He knows whatever goes into the earth (such as rain and seeds), and whatever comes forth out of it (such as moisture, plant and animal life-forms), and whatever descends from the heaven (such as rain, light, and angels), and whatever ascends into it (such as vapor, and supplications). And He is with you wherever you may be. And God sees well all that you do"
