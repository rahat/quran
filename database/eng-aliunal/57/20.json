    "text": "Know that the present, worldly life is but a play, vain talk and ostentation, and mutual boasting among you, and competing in wealth and children â€“ it is like when rain comes down and the vegetation grown by it pleases the farmers, (but) then it dries up and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes straw; and in the Hereafter there is a severe punishment, but also (there is) forgiveness from God and His good pleasure (which are everlasting); whereas the present, worldly life is but a transient enjoyment of delusion"
