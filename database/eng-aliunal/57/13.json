    "text": "On that Day the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say to those who believe: \"Wait for us that we may have some light from your light.\" It will be said: \"Turn back (if you can, to the world where such light was to be obtained), and seek light (through your deeds you did there).\" Just then a wall of separation will be put between them, with a gate therein (through which the hypocrites, so as to increase their regret, will observe the state of the believers). The inner side of the wall (which will separate the believers from the hypocrites) â€“ there will be in it the mercy (of eternal happiness), and outside it there will be the punishment (of eternal doom)"
