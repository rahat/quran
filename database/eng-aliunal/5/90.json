Intoxicants, games of chance, sacrifices to (anything serving the function of) idols (and at places consecrated for offerings to other than God), and (the pagan practice of) divination by arrows (and similar practices) are a loathsome evil of Satanâ€™s doing; so turn wholly away from it so that you may prosper (in both worlds)"
