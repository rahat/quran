You do not stand on anything valid (in God’s sight) unless you truly observe the Torah and the Gospel, and all that has been sent down to you from your Lord, (and doing that you would believe in me and the Qur’an, and follow my way).\" However, what is sent down to you from your Lord surely increases many of them in rebellion and unbelief. But grieve not for the disbelieving people"
