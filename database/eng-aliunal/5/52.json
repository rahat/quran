    "text": "Yet you (O Messenger) see those, in whose hearts there is a sickness (that dries up the source of their spiritual life, extinguishes their power of understanding and corrupts their character), hastening towards them (to get their friendship and patronage) as if competing with one another, saying, \"We fear lest a turn of fortune should befall us.\" But it may be that God will bring about (for the believers) victory or some other outcome of His own will (to punish those hypocrites or the wrongdoers whose friendship and patronage they seek). And then they will find themselves utterly regretful for the secrets they (as hypocrites) sought to keep hidden in their selves"
