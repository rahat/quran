Now, after a long interlude during which no Messengers have appeared, there has indeed come to you Our Messenger, making the whole truth clear to you, lest you should say, \"There has not come to us any bearer of good tidings, nor any warner.\" Indeed, there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner. And God has full power over everything"
