    "text": "They ask you (O Messenger) what is lawful for them (including in particular the game caught by trained hunting animals). Say: Lawful for you are (all) pure, wholesome things; and (as for) such hunting animals as you have trained as hounds teaching them from what God has taught you: you may eat of what they have caught for you (and brought to you dead or alive without themselves having eaten thereof). And pronounce Godâ€™s Name (while dispatching them to hunt for you). Keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety. Surely God is swift at reckoning"
