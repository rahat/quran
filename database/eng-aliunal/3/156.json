    "text": "O you who believe! Be not as those who disbelieve and say of their brothers who (died) after having set out on a journey or gone forth to war, \"Had they remained with us, they would not have died or been killed.\" God wills that such thoughts as this should be a cause of sighs and anguish in their hearts. God (He alone) gives life and causes to die; and whatever you do, God sees it well"
