    "text": "Then, after grief, He sent down peace and security for you: a slumber overtook some of you; and some, being concerned (merely) about themselves, were entertaining false notions about God – notions of (the pre-Islamic) Ignorance – and saying: \"Do we have any part in the authority (in the decision-making)?\" Say (to them, O Messenger): \"The authority rests with God exclusively.\" Indeed, they concealed within themselves what they would not reveal to you, and were saying (among themselves): \"If only we had had a part in the authority (in the decision-making), we would not have been killed here.\" Say (O Messenger): \"Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom killing had been ordained would indeed have gone forth to the places where they were to lie (in death).\" (All of this happened as it did) so that He may test what (thoughts, intentions, and inclinations) is in your bosoms and purify and prove what is (the faith) in your hearts. God has full knowledge of what lies hidden in the bosoms"
