We have made the night and the day two signs (manifesting the truth of Godâ€™s Power, Knowledge, and absolute sovereignty, and His grace on you). We have obscured the sign of the night (made it dark) and We have made the sign of the day illuminating (therefore a means for you) to see, that you may seek bounty from your Lord and that you may know the computation of (time) the years and the reckoning; We set out all things in clear detail"
