    "text": "If you do not help him (the Messenger), yet for certain God helped him when those who disbelieve drove him out (of his home during the Hijrah), the second of the two when they were in the cave (with those in pursuit of them having reached the mouth of the cave), and he said to his companion (with utmost trust in God and no worry at all): \"Do not grieve. God is surely with us.\" Then God sent down His gift of inner peace and reassurance on him, supported him with hosts you cannot see, and brought the word (the cause) of the unbelievers utterly low. And Godâ€™s word (His cause) is (always and inherently) supreme. God is All-Glorious with irresistible might, All-Wise"
