    "text": "How could there be a covenant with those who associate partners with God (and recognize no laws and treaty) on the part of God and His Messenger? â€“ excepting those with whom you made a treaty in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque: (as for the latter) so long as they remain true to you, be true to them. Surely God loves the God-revering, pious (who keep their duties to Him)"
