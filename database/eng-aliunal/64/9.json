    "text": "On the Day when He will assemble you all for the Day of Assembly â€“ that will be the day of loss for some (the unbelievers) and gain for some (the believers). Whoever believes in God and does good, righteous deeds, He will blot out from them their evil deeds (which they sometimes happen to commit), and admit them into Gardens through which rivers flow, therein to abide forever. That is the supreme triumph"
