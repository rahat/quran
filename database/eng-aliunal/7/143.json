    "text": "And when Moses came to Our appointed time, his Lord spoke to him. (Then, in the rapture of nearness to God arising from his being addressed by Him) he said: \"My Lord, show me Yourself, so that I may look upon You!\" He (God) said: \"You cannot see Me (with your eyes in the world). But look at that mountain: if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.\" And the moment his Lord manifested His glorious Majesty to the mountain, He made it crumble to dust, and Moses fell down in a faint (as if struck by lightning). When he awoke, he said: \"All-Glorified are You (in that You are absolutely above having any defects and any resemblance with the created)! I turn to You in repentance (for my desire to see You), and I am the first of the (true) believers (who realize that You are beyond any resemblance to any creature and beyond the grasp of any creatureâ€™s senses)"
