    "text": "We divided Mosesâ€™ people into twelve tribes, forming them into communities. We revealed to Moses when his people asked him for water (on the occasion that they were left without water in the desert), saying: \"Strike the rock with your staff!\" And (as soon as he struck) there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Each tribe knew their drinking place. And We caused the cloud to shade them, and sent down upon them manna and quails: \"Eat of the pure, wholesome things that We have provided for you.\" And (by disobeying Our commandments) they wronged not Us, but themselves they used to wrong"
