A manifest proof has assuredly come to you from your Lord. So give full measure and weight (in all your dealings), and do not wrong people by depriving them of what is rightfully theirs, and do not cause disorder and corruption in the land seeing that it has been so well ordered. That is for your own good, if you are (to be) true believers"
