    "text": "There is no blame on them (the wives of the Prophet, if they speak without a screen) with their fathers (including grandfathers and uncles both paternal and maternal), or their sons (including grandsons), or their brothers, or their brothersâ€™ sons, or the sons of their sisters, or the Muslim women and women of good conduct with whom they associate, or those (bondsmaids) whom their right hands possess. Keep, (O wives of the Prophet,) from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety (observing this command as well as all of His other commands). God is indeed a witness over everything"
