    "text": "O (most illustrious) Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have already paid their bridal-due, as well as those whom your right hands possess from among the captives of war that God has granted you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and maternal aunts, who have emigrated (to Madinah) for God’s cause as you did; and any believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet (freely, without demanding any bridal-due) if the Prophet wants to marry her – a rule (of privilege) for you exclusively, not for the believers (in general) – We have (already decreed and) made known what We have enjoined on them with regard to their wives and those whom their right hands possess. (This exceptional privilege is) in order that there may not be any hindrance to you (in fulfilling your mission because of marriage relationships). God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
