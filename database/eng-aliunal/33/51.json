    "text": "You can put off whomever among them (who offer themselves to you freely) you please, and accept to yourself whomever you please, as you can defer the turn of visiting any of them (your wives) you please, and take to you whomever you please. There is no blame on you if you give precedence to one whom you deferred before. It will make it more likely that they are pleased, and do not grieve (when they are deferred), and that all of them will be content with your treatment of them. God knows (O people) whatever is in your hearts. God is indeed All-Knowing, All-Clement"
