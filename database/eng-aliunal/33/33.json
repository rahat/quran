And establish the Prayer in conformity with its conditions, and pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms, and obey God and His Messenger (in whatever they command). God only wills to remove from you, O members of the (Prophetâ€™s) household, all that may be loathsome, and to purify you to the utmost of purity"
