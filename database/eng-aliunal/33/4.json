    "text": "God has not made for any man two hearts within his body (one to be assigned for belief in and worship of Him and the other to belief in and worship of others). Nor has He made your wives whom you may declare to be (unlawful to you) as your mothersâ€™ back (to mean you divorce them ) your mothers (in fact). Nor has He made your adopted sons your sons (in fact). Those are only expressions you utter with your mouths. Whereas God speaks the truth and He guides to the right way"
