    "text": "They (the hypocritical ones) swear by God most solemnly that if you should ever order them, they would most certainly go forth (to fight in Godâ€™s cause). Tell them: \"Do not swear. What is expected of you is obedience of the proper kind, well-known. (So you should do what other believers do and therefore will go forth when commanded to do so without gestures indicating exaggeration and affectation).\" God is fully aware of all that you do"
