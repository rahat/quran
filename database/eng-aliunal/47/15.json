    "text": "A likeness of Paradise which the God-revering, pious are promised is this: in it are rivers of water incorruptible (in taste, smell, and color); and rivers of milk whose taste never changes; and rivers of wine delicious for the drinkers; and rivers of pure, clear honey. And in it there are also fruits of every kind for them, as well as forgiveness from their Lord (to bring unforeseen blessings). (Are those who will enjoy all this) like those who will abide in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink, so that it rends their bowels"
