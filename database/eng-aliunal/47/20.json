    "text": "Those who believe (look forward to a new surah conveying knowledge of Divine truths and Godâ€™s new commandments being sent down, and) say: \"If only a new surah were sent down!\" But when a decisive surah has been sent down in which fighting is mentioned (clearly as a commanded duty), you see those in whose hearts there is sickness looking at you with a look of one swooning to death. That is, in fact, what is expected of them"
