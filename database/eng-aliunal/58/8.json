    "text": "Have you not considered those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and yet reverted to what they had been forbidden, and held secret meetings to commit sins (such as drinking alcohol, gambling, and evading the Prayer), and for (urging one another to) offensiveness and disobedience to the Messenger (in his commands and prohibitions). (It is these very people who) when they come to you, salute you with a salutation that God has never taught you and with which He has never saluted you, and say to one another (in derision): \"Why does God not punish us for what we say (if Muhammad is truly His Prophet)?\" Hell will suffice them, they will enter it to roast. How evil a destination to arrive at"
