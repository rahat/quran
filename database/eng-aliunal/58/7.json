    "text": "Have you not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? There is not a secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of them, nor between five but He is the sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them wherever they may be. Thereafter He will make them truly understand all that they do (and call them to account) on the Day of Resurrection. Surely God has full knowledge of everything"
