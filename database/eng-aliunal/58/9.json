If you hold secret counsels, do not hold secret counsels to commit sins, or for (urging one another to) offensiveness, and disobedience to the Messenger; but rather hold counsels for godliness, and righteousness, and piety. Keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety, to Whom you will be gathered"
