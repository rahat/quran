    "text": "Those among you who declare their wives to be unlawful for them by using of them the expression \"Be as my mother’s back to me,\" (should know that) their wives are not their mothers. Their mothers are none other than the women who gave them birth. Such men certainly utter a word abhorred (by the Shari‘ah) and a falsehood. Yet God is surely All-Pardoning (He overlooks the faults of His servants), All-Forgiving"
