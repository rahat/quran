    "text": "O you who believe! When you are told, \"Make room in the assemblies (for one another and for new comers),\" do make room. God will make room for you (in His grace and Paradise). And when you are told, \"Rise up (and leave the assembly),\" then do rise up. God will raise (in degree) those of you who truly believe (and act accordingly), and in degrees those who have been granted the knowledge (especially of religious matters). Surely God is fully aware of all that you do"
