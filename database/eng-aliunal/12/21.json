    "text": "The man who bought him in Egypt said to his wife: \"Give him honorable, good lodging. It may be that he will prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.\" Thus did We establish Joseph in the land (Egypt), that We would impart to him knowledge and understanding of the inner meaning of events, including dreams. God always prevails in whatever be His Will, but most people do not know (that it is so)"
