    "text": "What is there to keep people from believing when guidance has come to them, and from imploring their Lord for forgiveness â€“ unless it be that they follow the way of the (sinful) people of olden times (as if wishing for their fate to come upon them) or the punishment (which they did not believe in but asked their Prophet, in derision, to bring down upon them) come and confront them? (Then indeed they would have no opportunity to implore forgiveness and hope for relief)"
