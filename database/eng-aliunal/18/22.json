    "text": "(Instead of reflecting on the lesson to be learnt from the People of the Cave, people concentrate their interest on the details of the event.) Some will say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and some will say they were five, the dog being the sixth â€“ all guessing at random at (something related to) the Unseen. Still others will say: \"They were seven, the dog being the eighth.\" Say (O Messenger): \"My Lord knows their number better; it is but few that know (the truth about) them.\" So do not argue about them, being content with what is obvious (to you through Revelation), nor ask any of them (who argue even among themselves) to give you an opinion about them"
