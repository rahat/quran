    "text": "Such being their state, We raised them up so they began to ask one another. One who spoke said: \"How long have you stayed?\" They (some among them) answered: \"We have stayed a day, or part of a day.\" The others said: \"Your Lord knows better how long you have stayed. Now (we must deal with our hunger. So) send one of you to the city with this coin of yours: let him see what food is most pure there (and so lawful), and bring a supply from it. But let him behave with utmost care and guarded courtesy and by no means make anyone aware of you"
