    "text": "House them (the divorced women during their waiting-period in a part of the house) where you dwell and provide for them, according to your means; and do not harass them so as to straiten conditions for them (thus forcing them to leave). If they are pregnant, maintain them until they deliver their burden; and if (after delivery and the waiting-period has ended) they suckle (the baby) for you, give them their due payment. Take counsel with each other (about the matter and payment for suckling) according to customary good and religiously approvable practice. If you find yourselves making difficulties (and so unable to come to an agreement), then let another (woman) suckle (the baby) on behalf of him (the babyâ€™s father, who must settle the expense)"
