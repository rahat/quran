    "text": "So, be patient (O Messenger), (with their rejection of faith and with whatever they do), just as those of greatest steadfastness and resolution among the Messengers were patient, and do not seek to hasten (the judgment on) them. The Day when they see what they are threatened with, (they will feel) as if they had not stayed (in the world) save a short while of the day only. The message has been conveyed. Will, then, any be destroyed save the people who transgress the bounds (in belief and action)"
