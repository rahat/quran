    "text": "Always bear in mind that Godâ€™s Messenger is among you (so that you have a duty to refer decisions to him). If he were to follow you in many affairs of public concern, you would surely be in trouble (and suffer loss). But God has endeared the faith to you (O believers) and made it appealing to your hearts, and He has made unbelief, transgression, and rebellion hateful to you. Those are they who are rightly guided (in belief, thought, and action)"
