However, (if you do not mend your ways, know that) His punishment cannot be averted from disbelieving criminals"

Say (to them): \"Do you have any sound, authoritative knowledge (to support your claim)? (If you have) then bring it out for us! In fact you follow only conjecture, and you yourselves are only making false surmises (you pronounce judgments and act only according to your fancies, interests and personal value judgments)"
