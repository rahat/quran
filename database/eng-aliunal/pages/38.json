When they have reached the end of the waiting term, then there is no blame on you for what they may do by themselves within (the bounds of) decency. God is fully aware of all that you do"

God knows that you will think of them (with such proposals in mind), but do not make any secret engagement with them, except that you speak it properly in decent words. Do not resolve on the marriage tie until the ordained term has come to its end. Know that God knows what is in your hearts, so be careful about Him; and know that God is All-Forgiving, All-Clement, (Who shows no haste in punishing)"

Yet, make some provision for them, the affluent according to his means, and the straitened according to his means â€“ a provision according to customary good and religiously approvable practice, as a duty upon those devoted to doing good, aware that God is seeing them"

If you make remission, this is nearer and more suited to piety, and do not forget magnanimity among yourselves. Whatever you do, surely God sees it well"
