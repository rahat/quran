Assuredly there came to them Our Messengers (one after the other) with clear proofs of the truth (so that they might be revived both individually and as a people). Then (in spite of all this), many of them go on committing excesses on the earth"

Such is their disgrace in the world, and for them is a mighty punishment in the Hereafter"
