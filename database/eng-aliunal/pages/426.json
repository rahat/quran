Keep, (O wives of the Prophet,) from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety (observing this command as well as all of His other commands). God is indeed a witness over everything"

O you who believe, invoke the blessings of God on him, and pray to God to bestow His peace on him, greeting him with the best greeting.

Tell your wives and your daughters, as well as the women (wives and daughters) of the believers, to draw over themselves some part of their outer garments (when outside their homes and when before men whom they are not forbidden to marry because of blood relation). This is better and more convenient for them to be recognized (and respected for their decency and decorum) and not harrassed. God is indeed All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
