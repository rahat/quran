Those (are they) in whose hearts God has inscribed faith and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him (which is the source of their spiritual vigor and intellectual enlightenment). And He will admit them into Gardens through which rivers flow, therein to abide. God is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. Those are the party of God. Be aware: the party of God are those who are the prosperous"
