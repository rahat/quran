Whoever is in haste and content with two days (of mentioning God, having performed the rite of throwing pebbles at Satan), it is no sin for him; and whoever delays (continuing the rite to the third day), it is no sin for him, for him who is careful of the bounds of piety. Keep from disobedience to God in due reverence for Him and piety, and know that you will be gathered to Him"
