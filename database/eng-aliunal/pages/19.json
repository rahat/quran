Now, you surely do admit Abraham’s Prophethood, so) remember that his Lord tested Abraham with commands and ordeals (such as his being thrown into a fire, the destruction of the people of his kinsman Lot, and his being ordered to sacrifice his son Ishmael), and he fulfilled them thoroughly. He said: \"Indeed I will make you an imam for all people.\" He (Abraham) pleaded: \"(Will You appoint imams) also from my offspring?\" He (his Lord) answered: \"(I will appoint from among those who merit it.
