Say (to them): \"(Rather than doing nothing for fear of doing wrong) set their affairs aright for their good, that is the best. If you intermix (your expenses) with theirs, (there is no harm in that) for they are your brothers(-in-religion, and brotherhood demands doing what is good for oneâ€™s brothers). God knows well him who causes disorder from him who sets aright. Had God willed, He would have imposed on you exacting conditions. Indeed He is All-Glorious with irresistible might, All-Wise"

A believing slave-girl is better than a (free) woman who associates partners with God, even though she pleases and attracts you (with her beauty, wealth, status, or family). Nor marry (your believing women) to the men who associate partners with God until they believe. A believing slave is better than a (free) man who associates partners with God, even though he pleases and attracts you. Those call to the Fire, while God calls to Paradise and forgiveness (of your sins) by His leave. He makes clear His Revelations for people, that they may reflect and be mindful (of their duty to God)"

When they are cleansed, then (you can) go to them inasmuch as God has commanded you (according to the urge He has placed in your nature and within the terms He has enjoined upon you).
