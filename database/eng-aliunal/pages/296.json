When they (the people) disputed about their affair, they said: \"Build a structure over them (to hide them and leave them to their rest). Their Lord knows best about them.\" Those who prevailed (in the long-disputed matter) said: \"We will most certainly build a place of worship over them"

Some will say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and some will say they were five, the dog being the sixth â€“ all guessing at random at (something related to) the Unseen. Still others will say: \"They were seven, the dog being the eighth.\" Say (O Messenger): \"My Lord knows their number better; it is but few that know (the truth about) them.\" So do not argue about them, being content with what is obvious (to you through Revelation), nor ask any of them (who argue even among themselves) to give you an opinion about them"
