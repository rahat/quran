Whatever the Messenger gives you accept it willingly, and whatever he forbids you, refrain from it. Keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety. Surely God is severe in retribution"

(They too have a share in such gains of war.) Whoever is guarded against the avarice of his own soul – those are the ones who are truly prosperous"
