And those who disbelieve, their confidants and guardians are the taghut (authorities who rule and devise false religions and systems in defiance of God); bringing them out from the light into all kinds of darkness. Those are companions of the Fire; and they will abide therein"

When Abraham said, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes to die,\" he retorted: \"I give life and make to die.\" Said Abraham: \"Surely God causes the sun to rise in the east, now you cause it to rise in the west.\" Thus was the unbeliever utterly confounded.

But look at your food and drink: it has not spoiled; and look at your donkey! So We would make you a sign for the people (that they might understand how We have created them and will restore life to them after their death.) And look at the bones, how We will set them up, and then clothe them with flesh.\" Thus when the truth became clear to him, he said: \"I know that God has full power over everything"
