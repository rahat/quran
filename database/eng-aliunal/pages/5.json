Every time they are provided with fruits (of different color, shape, taste, and fragrance and that are constantly renewed) therefrom, they say, \"This is what we were provided with before.\" For they are given to them in resemblance (to what was given to them both in the world, and just before in the Gardens, familiar in shape and color so that they may not be unattractive because unknown). Furthermore, for them are spouses eternally purified (of all kinds of worldly uncleanliness). They will abide there (forever)"

Those who have already believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. As to those whose unbelief has long been established in their hearts, they say, \"What does God mean by such a parable?\" Thereby He leads many astray, and thereby He guides many. He thereby leads none astray save the transgressors"
