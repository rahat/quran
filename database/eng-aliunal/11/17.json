Those (who make and understand the comparison) believe in it (the Qur’an); while whoever from the diverse parties (belonging to different nations and faiths, knowingly) disbelieves in it – the Fire will be their promised place. And so you should not have the least doubt of it (being revealed by God). Surely, it is the truth from your Lord, though most of the people do not believe"
