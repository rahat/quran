    "text": "O you who believe! Turn to God in sincere and reforming repentance. It is hoped that your Lord will blot your evil deeds from you and admit you into Gardens through which rivers flow, on a Day when God will not disgrace nor disappoint the Prophet and those who believe in his company. Their (the believersâ€™) light will shine and spread before them and on their right hands, as they are saying: \"Our Lord! Perfect our light (by Your grace so that we may reach Paradise), and forgive us. Surely You have full power over everything"
