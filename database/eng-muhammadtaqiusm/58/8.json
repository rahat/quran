They whisper for sinful act and wrongdoing and disobedience of the prophet, and when they come to you, they greet you the way Allah does not greet you, and say to themselves, .Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?. Enough for them is Jahannam (Hell); they will enter it, and it is an evil end"
