    "text": "Who is more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah or says, .Revelation has been sent to me., whereas no revelation has been sent to him, and the one who says, .I would produce the like of what Allah has revealed. If only you could witness when the unjust are in the throes of death, and the angels stretch their hands (and say), .Out with your souls. Today, you shall have your punishment, a punishment of humiliation, because you have been saying about Allah what is not true, and have been showing arrogance against His verses"
