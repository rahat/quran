Say, .Who has sent down the Book brought by Musa as a light and a guidance for people, which you keep in various sheets (some of which) you disclose, and a lot of which you conceal, and (by which) you were taught what you did not know, neither you nor your fathers?. Say, .Allah. Then leave them to play with whatever they indulge in"
