Thereafter, when He blesses him with some favor from Him, he forgets that for which he was calling Him earlier, and sets up partners for Allah, so that he leads others astray from His way. Say, .Enjoy (the pleasure of) your disbelief for a while, (then) surely, you are from among the people of the Fire"
