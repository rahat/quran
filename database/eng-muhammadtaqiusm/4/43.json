Do not go near Salah when you are intoxicated, until you know what you say, nor in a state of ‘major impurity‘., __save when you are traversing a way__until you take a bath. If you are sick, or in travel, or if one of you has come after relieving himself, or you have had contact with women, and you find no water, go for some clean dust and wipe your faces and hands (with it). Surely, Allah is Most- Pardoning, Most-Forgiving"
