    "text": "They seek a ruling from you. Say, \"Allah gives tou the ruling concerning Kalalah. If a person dies having no son, but he does have a sister, then she will get one half of what he leaves. (On the other hand) He will inherit her if she has no child. If there are two (sisters), they will get two third of what he leaves. If they are brothers and sisters, both male and female, then, the male will get a share equal to that of two females.\" Allah explains to you, lest you should go astray. Allah has full knowledge of everything"
