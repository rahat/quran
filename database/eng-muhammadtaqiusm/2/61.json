    "text": "And when you said, .Musa , we will no longer confine ourselves to a single food: So, pray for us to your Lord that He may bring forth for us of what the earth grows â€” of its vegetable, its cucumbers, its wheat, its lentils and its onions. He said, .Do you want to take what is inferior in exchange for what is better? Go down to a town, and you will have what you ask for. Then they were stamped with disgrace and misery, and they returned with wrath from Allah. That was because they used to deny the signs of Allah, and would slay the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and transgressed all limits"
