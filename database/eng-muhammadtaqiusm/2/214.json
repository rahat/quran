    "text": "Do you think that you will enter Paradise while you have not yet been visited by (difficult) circumstances like those that were faced by the people who passed away before you? They were afflicted by hardship and suffering, and were so shaken down that the prophet, and those who believed with him, started saying: .When (will come) the help of Allah?. (Then, they were comforted by the Prophet who said to them) ‘Behold, the help of Allah is near.‘"
