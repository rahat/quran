    "text": "Indeed, Allah does not feel shy in citing any parable, be it that of a gnat or of something above it (in meanness). Now, as for those who believe, they know it is the truth from their Lord; while those who disbelieve say, .What could Allah have meant by this parable?. By this He lets many go astray, and by this He makes many find guidance. But He does not let anyone go astray thereby except those who are sinful"
