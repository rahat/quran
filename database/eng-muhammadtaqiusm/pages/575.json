And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you (O Muslims,) cannot do it in regular way; therefore He turned to you in mercy. Now, recite as much of the Qur‘an as is easy (for you). He knows that some of you may be sick, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and yet others fighting in Allah‘s way. Therefore, recite as much of it as is easy. And establish Salah, and pay Zakah, and advance to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send ahead for your own-selves, you will find it with Allah much better in condition, and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Indeed Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
