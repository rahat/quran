You created from clay something in the shape of a bird, then you blew on it, and it became a bird by My leave. You cured those born blind and lepers by My leave. You raised the dead by My leave. I kept the children of Isra‘il away from you when you came to them with clear signs, and the disbelievers among them said, .This is nothing but a clear magic"
