Say, .Who has sent down the Book brought by Musa as a light and a guidance for people, which you keep in various sheets (some of which) you disclose, and a lot of which you conceal, and (by which) you were taught what you did not know, neither you nor your fathers?. Say, .Allah. Then leave them to play with whatever they indulge in"

If only you could witness when the unjust are in the throes of death, and the angels stretch their hands (and say), .Out with your souls. Today, you shall have your punishment, a punishment of humiliation, because you have been saying about Allah what is not true, and have been showing arrogance against His verses"
