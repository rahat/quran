Another group was worrying about their own selves, harboring thoughts about Allah that were untrue - thoughts of ignorance. They were saying, .Is there anything in our hands?. Say, .The whole thing belongs to Allah. They conceal in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say, .If we had any say in the matter, we would not have been killed here.Say, .If you were in your homes, those destined to be killed would have come out all the way to their (final) resting -places. (All this was done) so that Allah may test your inner qualities and may purify what is in your hearts. Allah is All-Aware of what lies in the hearts"

The result is that Allah makes it a remorse resting in their hearts. Allah gives life and brings death; Allah is watchful of what you do"
