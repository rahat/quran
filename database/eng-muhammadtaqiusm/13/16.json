    "text": "Say, .Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?. Say, .Allah. Say, .Have you, then, taken as protectors those besides Him who possess no power to cause benefit or harm even to themselves?. Say, .Is it that a blind person and a sighted one are equal, or that all sorts of the darkness and the light are alike?. Or, have they ascribed such partners with Allah who (according to their belief) have created (some of the creation) as He has created, and thus the creation seemed to them alike? Say, .Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the All-Dominant"
