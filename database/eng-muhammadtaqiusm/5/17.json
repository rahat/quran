    "text": "Certainly, infidels are those who say, .God is the MasiH, son of Maryam (Jesus son of Mary). Say, .Who then has the power to do anything against Allah, if He wills to eliminate the MasiH son of Maryam and his mother and all those on earth?. Unto Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. He creates what He wills. Allah is powerful over everything"
