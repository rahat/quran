    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say, .We are the sons of Allah and His favourites. Say, .Why then would He punish you for your sins? In fact, you are just human, among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. Unto Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, and unto Him is the return"
