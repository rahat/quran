    "text": "They are those who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram ), and (prevented) the sacrificial animals that were detained from reaching their due place. And (Allah would have allowed you to fight,) had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might have trampled them, and thus a painful situation might have arisen for you because of them unknowingly; (This situation was avoided) so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills. And if they (the believing men and women) had moved (from Makkah), We would surely have punished those of them who disbelieved with a painful punishment"
