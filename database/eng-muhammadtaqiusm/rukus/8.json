He said, .Do you want to take what is inferior in exchange for what is better? Go down to a town, and you will have what you ask for. Then they were stamped with disgrace and misery, and they returned with wrath from Allah. That was because they used to deny the signs of Allah, and would slay the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and transgressed all limits"
