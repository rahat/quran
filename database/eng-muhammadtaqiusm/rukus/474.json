(All this is) like a rain, the growth of which attracts the farmers, then it withers, and you see it turning yellow, then it becomes straw. And in the Hereafter there is a severe punishment (for the disbelievers), and forgiveness from Allah and (Allahâ€˜s) pleasure (for the believers and the righteous). The worldly life is nothing but a material of delusion"
