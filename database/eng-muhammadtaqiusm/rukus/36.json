So, Allah made him dead for a hundred years, then raised him saying: .How long did you remain (in this state)?. He said: .I remained for a day or part of a day. Said He: .Rather, you remained (dead) for a hundred years. Just look at your food and your drink; it has not spoiled. Now look at your donkey. (We did) this to make you a sign for people! Look at the bones, how We raise them, then dress them with flesh. So, when it was clear to him, he said: .I know that Allah is Powerful over everything"
