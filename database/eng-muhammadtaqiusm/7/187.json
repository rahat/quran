    "text": "They ask you about the Hour (i.e. the Doomsday), .When is it due to happen?. Say, .Its knowledge is only with my Lord. No one can unfold it except He at its time. It shall weigh heavy in the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but suddenly. They ask you as if you were aware of it. Say, .Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most of the people do not know"
