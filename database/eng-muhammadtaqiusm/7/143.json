    "text": "When Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, .My Lord, show (Yourself) to me that I may look at You. He said: .You shall never see Me. But look at the mount. If it stays at its place, you will see Me. So when his Lord appeared to the Mount, He made it smashed, and Musa fell down unconscious. When he recovered, he said: .Pure are You. I repent to You, and I am the first to believe (that no one can see You in this world)"
