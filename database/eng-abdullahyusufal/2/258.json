    "text": "Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: \"My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and death\". Said Abraham: \"But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.\" Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust"
