    "text": "When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: \"Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?\" He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: \"Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin"
