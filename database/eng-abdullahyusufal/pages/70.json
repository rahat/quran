They said: \"What affair is this of ours?\" Say thou: \"Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah's.\" They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): \"If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts"

Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.\" This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do"
