    "text": "Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah, or saith, \"I have received inspiration,\" when he hath received none, or (again) who saith, \"I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed\"? If thou couldst but see how the wicked (do fare) in the flood of confusion at death! - the angels stretch forth their hands, (saying),\"Yield up your souls: this day shall ye receive your reward,- a penalty of shame, for that ye used to tell lies against Allah, and scornfully to reject of His signs"
