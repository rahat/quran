    "text": "Test orphans until they reach marriageable age; then, if you find they have sound judgement, hand over their property to them. Do not consume it hastily before they come of age: if the guardian is well off he should abstain from the orphanâ€™s property, and if he is poor he should use only what is fair. When you give them their property, call witnesses in; but God takes full account of everything you do"
