    "text": "but God has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving Godâ€™s warning, stops taking usury may keep his past gains- God will be his judge- but whoever goes back to usury will be an inhabitant of the Fire, there to remain. God blights usury, but blesses charitable deeds with multiple increase: He does not love the ungrateful sinner"
