    "text": "If We had revealed the Koran in a foreign language, they had surely said, unless the signs thereof be distinctly explained, we will not receive the same: Is the book written in a foreign tongue, and the person unto whom it is directed, an Arabian? Answer, it is, unto those who believe, a sure guide, and a remedy for doubt and uncertainty: But unto those who believe not, it is a thickness of hearing in their ears, and it is a darkness which covereth them; these are as they who are called unto from a distant place"
