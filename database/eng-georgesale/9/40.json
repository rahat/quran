    "text": "If ye assist not the prophet, verily God will assist him, as he assisted him formerly, when the unbelievers drove him out of Mecca, the second of two: When they were both in the cave; when he said unto his companion, be not grieved, for God is with us. And God sent down his security upon him, and strenghtened him with armies of angels, whom ye saw not. And He made the word of those who believed not, to be abased, and the word of God was exalted; for God is mighty and wise"
