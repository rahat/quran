    "text": "As they who have been before you, so are ye. They were superior to you in strength, and had more abundance of wealth and of children; and they enjoyed their portion in this world; and ye also enjoy your portion here, as they who have preceded you, enjoyed their portion. And ye engage your selves in vain discourses, like unto those wherein they engaged themselves. The works of these are vain both in this world, and in that which is to come; and these are they who perish"
