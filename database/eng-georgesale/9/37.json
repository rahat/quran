    "text": "Verily the transferring of a sacred month to another month, is an additional infidelity. The unbelievers are led into an error thereby: They allow a month to be violated one year, and declare it sacred another year, that they may agree in the number of months which God hath commanded to be kept sacred; and they allow that which God hath forbidden. The evil of their actions hath been prepared for them: For God directeth not the unbelieving people"
