There is no private discourse among three persons, but He is the fourth of them; nor among five, but He is the sixth of them; neither among a smaller number than this, nor a larger, but He is with them; wheresoever they be: And He will declare unto them that which they have done, on the day of resurrection; for God knoweth all things"

And when they come unto thee, they salute thee with that form of salutation wherewith God doth not salute thee: And they say among themselves, by way of derision, would not God punish us for what we say, if this man were a prophet? Hell shall be their sufficient punishment: They shall go down into the same to be burned; and an unhappy journey shall it be"
