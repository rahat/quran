When Abraham said, my Lord is he who giveth life, and killeth: He answered, I give life, and I kill. Abraham said, verily God bringeth the sun from the east, now do thou bring it from the west. Whereupon the infidel was confounded; for God directeth not the ungoldly people"

Now look on thy food and thy drink, they are not yet corrupted; and look on thine ass: And this have we done that we might make thee a sign unto men. And look on the bones of thine ass, how we raise them, and afterwards cloath them with flesh. And when this was shewn unto him, he said, I know that God is able to do all things"
