The latter of them shall say of the former of them, O Lord, these have seduced us; therefore inflict on them a double punishment of the fire of hell. God shall answer, it shall be doubled unto all; but ye know it not"

And it shall be proclaimed unto them, this is paradise, whereof ye are made heirs, as a reward for that which ye have wrought"
