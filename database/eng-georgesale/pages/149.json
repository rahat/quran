We will not impose a task on any soul, beyond its ability. And when ye pronounce judgement observe justice, although it be for or against one who is near of kin, and fulfill the covenant of God. This hath God commanded you, that ye may be admonished"

We will reward those who turn aside from our signs with a grievous punishment, because they have turned aside"
