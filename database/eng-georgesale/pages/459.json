He formeth you in the wombs of your mothers, by several gradual formations, within three vails of darkness. This is God your Lord: His is the kingdom: There is no God but He. Why therefore are ye turned aside from the worship of Him to idolatry"

Say unto such a man, enjoy this life in thy infidelity for a little while: But hereafter shalt thou surely be one of the inhabitants of hell fire"
