            "text": "O ye who have received the scriptures, exceed not the just bounds in your religion, neither say of God any other than the truth. Verily Christ Jesus the son of Mary is the apostle of God, and his word, which he conveyed into Mary, and a spirit proceeding from him. Believe therefore in God, and his apostles, and say not, there are three Gods; forbear this; it will be better for you. God is but one God. Far be it from Him that He should have a son! Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is a sufficient protector"
