In the hearts of these hath God written faith; and He hath strengthened them with his spirit: And He will lead them into gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever. God is well pleased in them; and they are well pleased in Him. These are the party of God: And shall not the party of God prosper"

They pulled down their houses with their own hands, and the hands of the true believers. Wherefore take example from them, O ye who have eyes"
