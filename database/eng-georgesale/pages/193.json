The unbelievers are led into an error thereby: They allow a month to be violated one year, and declare it sacred another year, that they may agree in the number of months which God hath commanded to be kept sacred; and they allow that which God hath forbidden. The evil of their actions hath been prepared for them: For God directeth not the unbelieving people"

And God sent down his security upon him, and strenghtened him with armies of angels, whom ye saw not. And He made the word of those who believed not, to be abased, and the word of God was exalted; for God is mighty and wise"
