Did you hasten to devise a way for yourselves without waiting for the command of your Lord?' And he put down the tablet and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, 'Son of my mother, the people indeed deemed me weak, and were about to kill me. Therefore make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune and place me not with the unjust people"
