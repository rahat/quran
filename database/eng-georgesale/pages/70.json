Say, verily the matter belongeth wholly unto God. They concealed in their minds what they declared not unto thee; saying, if any thing of the matter had happened unto us, we had not been slain here. Answer, if ye had been in your houses, verily they would have gone forth to fight, whose slaughter was decreed, to the places where they died, and this came to pass that God might try what was in your breasts, and might discern what was in your hearts; for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men"

God giveth life, and causeth to die: And God seeth that which ye do"
