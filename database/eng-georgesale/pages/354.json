And unto such of your slaves as desire a written instrument allowing them to redeem themselves on paying a certain sum, write one, if ye know good in them; and give them of the riches of God, which He hath given you. And compel not your maid-servants to prostitute themselves, if they be willing to live chastly; that ye may seek the casual advantage of this present life: But whoever shall compel them thereto, verily God will be gracious and merciful unto such women after their compulsion"

It is lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east, nor of the west: It wanteth little but that the oil thereof would give light, although no fire touched it. This is light added unto light: God will direct unto his light whom He pleaseth. God propoundeth parables unto men; for God knoweth all things"
