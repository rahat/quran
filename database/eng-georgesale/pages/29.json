            "text": "It is lawful for you on the night of the fast to go in unto your wives; they are a garment unto you, and ye are a garment unto them. God knoweth that ye defraud your selves therein, wherefore he turneth unto you, and forgiveth you. Now therefore go in unto them; and earnestly desire that which God ordaineth you, and eat and drink until ye can plainly distinguish a white thread from a black thread by the day-break: Then keep the fast until night, and go not in unto them, but be constantly present in the places of worship. These are the prescribed bounds of God, therefore draw not near them to transgress them. Thus God declareth his signs unto men, that they may fear him"

It is not righteousness that ye enter your houses by the back parts thereof, but righteousness is of him who feareth God. Therefore enter your houses by their doors; and fear God, that ye may be happy"
