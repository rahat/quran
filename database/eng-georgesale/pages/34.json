They will not cease to war against you, until they turn you from your religion, if they be able: But whoever among you shall turn back from his religion, and die an infidel, their works shall be vain in this world, and the next; they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever"

They will ask thee also what they shall bestow in alms: Answer, what ye have to spare. Thus God sheweth his signs unto you, that peradventure ye might seriously think"
