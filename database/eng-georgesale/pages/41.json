And they drank thereof, except a few of them. And when they had passed the river, he and those who believed with him, they said, we have no strength to day, against Jalut and his forces. But they who considered that they should meet God at the resurrection, said, how often hath a small army discomfited a great army, by the will of God? And God is with those who patiently persevere"
