If ye go forth to fight in defence of my religion, and out of a desire to please me, and privately shew friendship unto them; verily I well know that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover: And whoever of you doth this, hath already erred from the strait path"

O Lord, in thee do we trust, and unto thee are we turned; and before thee shall we be assembled hereafter"
