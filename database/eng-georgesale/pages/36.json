The women ought also to behave towards their husbands in like manner as their husbands should behave towards them, according to what is just: But the men ought to have a superiority over them.

And if ye fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God, it shall be no crime in either of them of account of that for which the wife shall redeem her self. These are the ordinances of God; therefore transgress them not; for whoever transgresseth the ordinances of God, they are unjust doers"
