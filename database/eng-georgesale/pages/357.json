They shall worship Me; and shall not associate any other with Me. But whoever shall disbelieve after this; they will be the wicked doers"

These are the three times for you to be private: It shall be no crime in you, or in them, if they go into you without asking permission after these times, while ye are in frequent attendance, the one of you on the other. Thus God declareth his signs unto you; for God is knowing and wise"
