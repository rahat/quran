    "text": "And let those who find not a match, keep themselves from fornication, until God shall enrich them of his abundance. And unto such of your slaves as desire a written instrument allowing them to redeem themselves on paying a certain sum, write one, if ye know good in them; and give them of the riches of God, which He hath given you. And compel not your maid-servants to prostitute themselves, if they be willing to live chastly; that ye may seek the casual advantage of this present life: But whoever shall compel them thereto, verily God will be gracious and merciful unto such women after their compulsion"
