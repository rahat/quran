    "text": "Let not the calling of the apostle be esteemed among you, as your calling the one to the other. God knoweth such of you as privately withdraw themselves from the assembly, taking shelter behind one another. But let those who withstand his command, take heed; lest some calamity befall them in this world, or a grievous punishment be inflicted on them in the life to come"
