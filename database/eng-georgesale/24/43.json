    "text": "Dost thou not see that God gently driveth forward the clouds, and gathereth them together, and then layeth them on heaps? Thou also seest the rain, which falleth from the midst thereof; and God sendeth down from heaven as it were mountains, wherein there is hail; He striketh therewith whom He pleaseth, and turneth the same away from whom He pleaseth: The brightness of his lightning wanteth but little of taking away the sight"
