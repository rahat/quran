    "text": "Verily they only are true believers, who believe in God and his apostle, and when they are assembled with him on any affair, depart not, until they have obtained leave of him. Verily they who ask leave of thee, are those who believe in God and his apostle. When therefore they ask leave of thee to depart, on account of any business of their own, grant leave unto such of them as thou shalt think fit, and ask pardon for them of God; for God is gracious and merciful"
