    "text": "God is the light of heaven and earth: The similitude of his light is as a niche in a wall, wherein a lamp is placed, and the lamp inclosed in a case of glass; the glass appears as it were a shining star. It is lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east, nor of the west: It wanteth little but that the oil thereof would give light, although no fire touched it. This is light added unto light: God will direct unto his light whom He pleaseth. God propoundeth parables unto men; for God knoweth all things"
