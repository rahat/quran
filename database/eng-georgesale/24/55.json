    "text": "God promiseth unto such of you as believe, and do good works, that he will cause them to succeed the unbelievers in the earth, as he caused those who were before you to succeed the infidels of their time; and that he will establish for them their religion which pleaseth them, and will change their fear into security. They shall worship Me; and shall not associate any other with Me. But whoever shall disbelieve after this; they will be the wicked doers"
