    "text": "And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie concerning God, or accuseth his signs of imposture? Unto these shall be given their portion of worldly happiness, according to what is written in the book of God's decrees, until our messengers come unto them, and shall cause them to die; saying, where are the idols which ye called upon, besides God? They shall answer, they have disappeared from us. And they shall bear witness against themselves, that they were unbelievers"
