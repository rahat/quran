    "text": "If we return to your religion after God has saved us therefrom, we would indeed admit that we had been forging a lie against God. And it behoves us not to return thereto except that God, our Lord, should so will. Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In God have we put our trust. So, Our Lord, decide Thou between us and between our people with truth and Thou art the Best of those who decide"
