    "text": "Do they wait for any other than the interpretation thereof? On the day whereon the interpretation thereof shall come, they who had forgotten the same before, shall say, now are we convinced by demonstration that the messengers of our Lord came unto us with truth: Shall we therefore have any intercessors, who will intercede for us? Or shall we be sent back into the world, that we may do other works than what we did in our life-time? But now have they lost their souls; and that which they impiously imagined, hath fled from them"
