    "text": "God shall say unto them at the resurrection, enter ye with the nations which have preceded you, of genii and of men, into hell fire: So often as one nation shall enter, it shall curse its sister, until they shall all have successively entered therein. The latter of them shall say of the former of them, O Lord, these have seduced us; therefore inflict on them a double punishment of the fire of hell. God shall answer, it shall be doubled unto all; but ye know it not"
