    "text": "And We divided them into twelve tribes, distinct peoples. And, We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying, 'Strick the rock with thy rod;' and from it there gushed forth twelve springs; every tribe knew their drinking place. And We caused the clouds to overshadow them and We sent down for them Manna and Salwa and We said, 'Eat of the good things We have provided for you.' And they wronged Us not, but it was themselves that they wronged"
