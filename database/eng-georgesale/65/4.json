    "text": "As to such of your wives as shall despair having their courses, by reason of their age; if ye be in doubt thereof, let their term be three months: And let the same be the term of those who have not yet had their courses. But as to those who are pregnant, their term shall be, until they be delivered of their burden. And whoso feareth God, unto him will He make his command easy"
