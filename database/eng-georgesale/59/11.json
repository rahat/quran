They say unto their brethren who believe not, of those who have received the scriptures, verily if ye be expelled your habitations, we will surely go forth with you; and we will not pay obedience, in your respect, unto any one for ever: And if ye be attacked, we will certainly assist you. But God is witness that they are liars"
