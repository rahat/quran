    "text": "The spoils of the inhabitants of the towns which God hath granted to his apostle, are due unto God and to the apostle, and him who is of kin to the apostle, and the orphans, and the poor, and the traveller; that they may not be for ever divided in a circle among such of you as are rich: What the apostle shall give you, that accept; and what he shall forbid you, that abstain from: And fear God; for God is severe in chastising"
