    "text": "Ye have an excellent pattern in Abraham, and those who were with him, when they said unto their people, verily we are clear of you, and of the idols which ye worship, besides God: We have renounced you; and enmity and hatred is begun between us and you for ever, until ye believe in God alone: Except Abraham's saying unto his father, verily I will beg pardon for thee; but I cannot obtain ought of God in thy behalf. O Lord, in thee do we trust, and unto thee are we turned; and before thee shall we be assembled hereafter"
