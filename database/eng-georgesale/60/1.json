    "text": "O true believers, take not my enemy and your enemy for your friends, shewing kindness toward them; since they believe not in the truth which hath come unto you, having expelled the apostle and yourselves from your native city, because ye believe in God, your Lord. If ye go forth to fight in defence of my religion, and out of a desire to please me, and privately shew friendship unto them; verily I well know that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover: And whoever of you doth this, hath already erred from the strait path"
