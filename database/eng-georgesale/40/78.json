    "text": "We have sent a great number of apostles before thee; the histories of some of whom We have related unto thee, and the histories of others of them We have not related unto thee: But no apostle had the power to produce a sign, unless by the permission of God. When the command of God, therefore, shall come, judgment shall be given with truth; and then shall they perish who endeavour to render the signs of God of no effect"
