    "text": "And a man who was a true believer, of the family of Pharaoh, and concealed in his faith, said, will ye put a man to death, because he saith, God is my Lord; seeing he is come unto you with evident signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will the punishment of his falsehood light; but if he speaketh the truth, some of those judgments with which he threateneth you, will fall upon you: Verily God directeth not him who is a transgressor, or a liar"
