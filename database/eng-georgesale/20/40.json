So we returned thee unto thy mother, that her mind might be set at ease, and that she might not be afflicted. And thou slewest a soul, and we delivered thee from trouble; and we proved thee by several trials: And afterwards thou didst dwell some years among the inhabitants of Madian. Then thou camest hither according to our decree, O Moses"
