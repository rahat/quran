    "text": "Moses said, get thee gone; for thy punishment in this life shall be, that thou shalt say unto those who shall meet thee, touch me not; and a threat is denounced against thee of more terrible pains, in the life to come, which thou shalt by no means escape. And behold now thy god, to whose worship thou hast continued assiduously devoted: Verily we will burn it; and we will reduce it to powder, and scatter it in the sea"
