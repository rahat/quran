    "text": "Whom God shall direct, he shall be the rightly directed; and whom He shall cause to err, thou shalt find none to assist, besides him. And We will gather them together on the day of resurrection, creeping on their faces, blind, and dumb, and deaf: Their abode shall be hell; so often as the fire thereof shall be extinguished, We will rekindle a burning flame to torment them"
