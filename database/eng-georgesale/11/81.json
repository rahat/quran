    "text": "The angels said, O Lot, verily we are the messengers of thy Lord; they shall by no means come in unto thee. Go forth therefore with thy family, in some part of the night, and let not any of you turn back: But as for thy wife, that shall happen unto her, which shall happen unto them. Verily the prediction of their punishment shall be fulfilled in the morning: Is not the morning near"
