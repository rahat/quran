    "text": "O apostle, let not them grieve thee, who hasten to infidelity, either of those who say, we believe, with their mouths, but whose hearts believe not; or of the Jews, who hearken to a lie, and hearken to other people; who come not unto thee: They pervert the words of the law from their true places, and say, if this be brought unto you, receive it; but if it be not brought unto you, beware of receiving ought else; and in behalf of him whom God shall resolve to seduce , thou shalt not prevail with God at all. They whose hearts God shall not please to cleanse, shall suffer shame in this world, and a grievous punishment in the next"
