    "text": "O true believers, whoever of you apostatizeth from his religion, God will certainly bring other people to supply his place, whom He will love, and who will love Him; who shall be humble towards the believers, but severe to the unbelievers: They shall fight for the religion of God, and shall not fear the obloquy of the detracter. This is the bounty of God, He bestoweth it on whom He pleaseth: God is extensive and wise"
