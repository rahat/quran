    "text": "O ye who believe! the right evidence among you, when death comes to one of you, at the time of making a will, is of two just men from among you; or of two others not from among you, in case you be journeying in the land and the calamity of death befalls you. You shall detain them both after Prayer for giving evidence; and if you have doubt concerning their evidence, they shall both swear by God, saying, 'We will not take for this any price, even though the person affected thereby be a near relation, nor will we hide the testimony enjoined by God; surely in that case we shall be among the sinners"
