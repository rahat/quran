    "text": "The Jews and the Christians say, we are the children of God, and his beloved. Answer, why therefore doth he punish you for your sins? Nay, but ye are men, of those whom he hath created. He forgiveth whom he pleaseth, and punisheth whom he pleaseth, and unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and of what is contained between them both; and unto him shall all things return"
