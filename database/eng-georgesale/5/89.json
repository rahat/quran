    "text": "God will not take you to task for such of your oaths as are vain, but He will take you to task for breaking the oaths which you take in earnest. The expiation thereof, then, is the feeding of ten poor persons with such average food as you feed your families with, or the clothing of them or the freeing of a slave. But whoso finds not the means shall fast for three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn. And keep your oaths. Thus does God explain to you His Signs that you may be grateful"
