There is no private discourse among three persons, but He is the fourth of them; nor among five, but He is the sixth of them; neither among a smaller number than this, nor a larger, but He is with them; wheresoever they be: And He will declare unto them that which they have done, on the day of resurrection; for God knoweth all things"
