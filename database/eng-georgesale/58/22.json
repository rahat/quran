    "text": "Thou shalt not find people who believe in God and the last day, to love him who opposeth God and his apostle; although they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brethren, or their nearest relations. In the hearts of these hath God written faith; and He hath strengthened them with his spirit: And He will lead them into gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever. God is well pleased in them; and they are well pleased in Him. These are the party of God: And shall not the party of God prosper"
