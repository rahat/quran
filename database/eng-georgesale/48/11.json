    "text": "The Arabs of the desert who were left behind will say unto thee, our substance and our families employed us, so that we went not forth with thee to war; wherefore ask pardon for us. They speak that with their tongues, which is not in their hearts. Answer, who shall be able to obtain for you any thing from God to the contrary, if he is pleased to afflict you, or is pleased to be gracious unto you? Yea verily, God is well acquainted with that which ye do"
