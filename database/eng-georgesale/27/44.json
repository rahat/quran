    "text": "It was said unto her, enter the palace. And when she saw it, she imagined it to be a great water; and she discovered her legs, by lifting up her robe to pass through it. Whereupon Solomon said unto her, verily this is a palace evenly floored with glass. Then said the queen, O Lord, verily I have dealt unjustly with my own soul; and I resign my self, together with Solomon, unto God, the Lord of all creatures"
