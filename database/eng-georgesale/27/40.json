And when Solomon saw the throne placed before him, he said, this is a favour of my Lord, that he may make trial of me, whether I will be grateful, or whether I will be ungrateful: And he who is grateful, is grateful to his own advantage, but if any shall be ungrateful, verily my Lord is self-sufficient and munificent"
