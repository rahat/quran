    "text": "Each of them hath angels mutually succeeding each other, before him, and behind him; they watch him by the command of God. Verily God will not change his grace which is in men, until they change the disposition in their souls by sin. When God willeth evil on a people, there shall be none to avert it; neither shall they have any protector beside Him"
