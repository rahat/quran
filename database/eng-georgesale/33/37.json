    "text": "And remember when thou saidst to him unto whom God had been gracious, and on whom thou also hadst conferred favours, keep thy wife to thy self, and fear God: And thou didst conceal that in thy mind which God had determined to discover, and didst fear men; whereas it was more just that thou shouldst fear God. But when Zeid had determined the matter concerning her, and had resolved to divorce her, we joined her in marriage unto thee; lest a crime should be charged on the true believers, in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they have determined the matter concerning them: And the command of God is to be performed"
