They answered, we have tarried a day, or part of a day. The others said, your Lord, best knoweth the time ye have tarried: And now send one of you with this your money into the city, and let him see which of its inhabitants hath the best and cheapest food, and let him bring you provision from him; and let him behave circumspectly, and not discover you to any one"
