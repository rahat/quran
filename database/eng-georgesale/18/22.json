    "text": "Some say, the sleepers were three; and their dog was the fourth: And others say, they were five; and their dog was the sixth; guessing at a secret matter: And others say, they were seven; and their dog was the eighth. Say, my Lord best knoweth their number: None shall know them, except a few. Wherefore dispute not concerning them, unless with a clear disputation, according to what hath been revealed unto thee: And ask not any of the Christians concerning them"
