    "text": "Their Lord therefore answereth them, saying, I will not suffer the work of him among you who worketh to be lost, whether he be male, or female: The one of you is from the other. They therefore who have left their country, and have been turned out of their houses, and have suffered for my sake, and have been slain in battle; verily I will expiate their evil deeds from them, and I will surely bring them into gardens watered by rivers: a reward from God: And with God is the most excellent reward"
