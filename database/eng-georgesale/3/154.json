    "text": "Then he sent down upon you after affliction security; a soft sleep which fell on some part of you; but other part were troubled by their own souls; falsely thinking of God a foolish imagination, saying, will any thing of the matter happen unto us? Say, verily the matter belongeth wholly unto God. They concealed in their minds what they declared not unto thee; saying, if any thing of the matter had happened unto us, we had not been slain here. Answer, if ye had been in your houses, verily they would have gone forth to fight, whose slaughter was decreed, to the places where they died, and this came to pass that God might try what was in your breasts, and might discern what was in your hearts; for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men"
