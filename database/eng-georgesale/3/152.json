    "text": "God had already made good unto you his promise, when ye destroyed them by his permission, until ye became faint-hearted and disputed concerning the command of the apostle, and were rebellious; after God had shewn you what ye desired. Some of you chose this present world, and others of you chose the world to come. Then he turned you to flight from before them, that he might make trial of you: -- But he hath now pardoned you; for God is indued with beneficence towards the faithful"
