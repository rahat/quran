    "text": "They who have received the scriptures will demand of thee, that thou cause a book to descend unto them from heaven: They formerly asked of Moses a greater thing than this; for they said, shew us God visibly. Wherefore a storm of fire from heaven destroyed them, because of their iniquity. Then they took the calf for their God, after that evident proofs of the divine unity had come unto them: But we forgave them that, and gave Moses a manifest power to punish them"
