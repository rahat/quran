    "text": "Of the Jews there are some who pervert words from their places; and say, we have heard, and have disobeyed; and do thou hear without understanding our meaning, and look upon us: Perplexing with their tongues, and reviling the true religion. But if they had said, we have heard, and do obey; and do thou hear, and regard us: Certainly it were better for them, and more right. But God hath cursed them by reason of their infidelity; therefore a few of them only shall believe"
