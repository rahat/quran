    "text": "O true believers, observe justice when ye bear witness before God, although it be against your selves, or your parents, or relations; whether the party be rich, or whether he be poor; for God is more worthy than them both: Therefore follow not your own lust in bearing testimony, so that ye swerve from justice. And whether ye wrest your evidence, or decline giving it, God is well acquainted with that which ye do"
