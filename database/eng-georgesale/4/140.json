    "text": "And he hath already revealed unto you, in the book of the Koran, the following passage, when ye shall hear the signs of God, they shall not be believed, but they shall be laughed to scorn. Therefore sit not with them who believe not, until they engage in different discourse; for if ye do ye will certainly become like unto them. God will surely gather the ungodly and the unbelievers together in hell"
