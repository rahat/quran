    "text": "If a woman fear ill usage, or aversion from her husband, it shall be no crime in them if they agree the matter amicably between themselves; for a reconciliation is better than a separation. Mens souls are naturally inclined to covetousness: But if ye be kind towards women, and fear to wrong them, God is well acquainted with what ye do"
