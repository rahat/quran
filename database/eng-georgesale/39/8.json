    "text": "When harm befalleth a man, he calleth upon his Lord, and turneth unto Him: Yet afterwards, when God hath bestowed on him favour from himself, he forgetteth that being which he invoked before, and setteth up equals unto God, that he may seduce men from his way. Say unto such a man, enjoy this life in thy infidelity for a little while: But hereafter shalt thou surely be one of the inhabitants of hell fire"
