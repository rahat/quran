Say, do ye think therefore that the deities which ye invoke besides God, if God be pleased to afflict me, are able to relieve me from his affliction? Or if he be pleased to shew mercy unto me, that they are able to withhold his mercy? Say, God is my sufficient support: In him let those put their trust, who seek in whom to confide"
