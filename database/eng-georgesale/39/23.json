    "text": "God hath revealed a most excellent discourse; a book conformable to itself, and containing repeated admonitions. The skins of those who fear their Lord shrink for fear thereat: Afterwards their skins grow soft, and their hearts also, at the remembrance of their Lord. This is the direction of God: He will direct thereby whom He pleaseth; and whomsoever God shall cause to err, he shall have no director"
