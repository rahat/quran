    "text": "Verily the knowledge of the hour of judgment is with God: And He causeth the rain to descend, at his own appointed time; and He knoweth what is in the wombs of females. No soul knoweth what it shall gain on the morrow; neither doth any soul know in what land it shall die: But God is knowing and fully acquainted with all things"
