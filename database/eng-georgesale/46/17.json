Do ye promise me that I shall be taken forth from the grave, and restored to life; when many generations have passed away before me, and none of them have returned back? And his parents implore God's assistance, and say to their son, alas for thee! Believe: For the promise of God is true. But he answereth, this is no other than silly fables of the ancients"
