    "text": "A burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another: And if a heavy-burdened soul call on another to bear part of its burden, no part thereof shall be born by the person who shall be called on, although he be ever so nearly related. Thou shalt admonish those who fear their Lord in secret, and are constant at prayer: And whoever cleanseth himself from the guilt of disobedience cleanseth himself to the advantage of his own soul; for all shall be assembled before God at the last day"
