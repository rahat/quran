    "text": "O true believers, be ye the assistants of God; as Jesus the son of Mary said to the apostles, who will be my assistants with respect to God? The apostles answered, we will be the assistants of God. So a part of the children of Israel believed, and a part believed not: But We strengthened those who believed, above their enemy; wherefore they became victorious over them"
