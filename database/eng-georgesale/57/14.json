    "text": "The hypocrites shall call out unto the true believers, saying, were we not with you? They shall answer, yea; but ye seduced your own souls by your hypocrisy: And ye waited our ruin; and ye doubted concerning the faith; and your wishes deceived you, until the decree of God came, and ye died: And the deceiver deceived you concerning God"
