    "text": "And what aileth you, that ye contribute not of your substance for the defence of God's true religion? Since unto God appertaineth the inheritance of heaven and earth. Those among you who shall have contributed and fought in defence of the faith, before the taking of Mecca, shall not be held equal with those who shall contribute and fight for the same afterwards. These shall be superiour in degree unto those who shall contribute and fight for the propagation of the faith after the abovementioned success: But unto all hath God promised a most excellent reward; and God well knoweth that which ye do"
