    "text": "On that day the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women shall say unto those who believe, stay for us, that we may borrow some of your light. It shall be answered, return back into the world, and seek light. And a high wall shall be set betwixt them, wherein shall be a gate, within which shall be mercy; and without it, overagainst the same, the torment of hell"
