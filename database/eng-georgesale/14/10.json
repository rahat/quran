He inviteth you to the true faith that He may forgive you part of your sins, and may respite your punishment, by granting you space to repent, until an appointed time. They answered, ye are but men, like unto us: Ye seek to turn us aside from the gods which our fathers worshipped; wherefore bring us an evident demonstration by some miracle, that ye speak truth"
