    "text": "And they shall all come forth into the presence of God at the last day: And the weak among them shall say unto those who behaved themselves arrogantly, verily we were your followers on earth; will ye not therefore avert from us some part of the divine vengeance? They shall answer, if God had directed us aright, we had certainly directed you. It is equal unto us whether we bear our torments impatiently, or whether we endure them with patience: For we have no way to escape"
