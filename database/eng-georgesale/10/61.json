    "text": "Thou shalt be engaged in no business, neither shalt thou be employed in meditating on any passage of the Koran; nor shall ye do any action, but We will be witnesses over you, when ye are employed therein. Nor is so much as the weight of an ant hidden from thy Lord, in earth or in heaven: Neither is there any thing lesser than that, or greater, but it is written in the perspicuous book"
