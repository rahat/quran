    "text": "It is He who hath given you conveniencies for travelling by land and by sea; so that ye be in ships, which sail with them, with a favourable wind, and they rejoice therein. And when a tempestuous wind overtaketh them, and waves come upon them from every side, and they think themselves to be encompassed with inevitable dangers; they call upon God, exhibiting the pure religion unto Him, and saying, verily if Thou deliver us from this peril, we will be of those who give thanks"
