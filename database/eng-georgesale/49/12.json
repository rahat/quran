    "text": "O true believers, carefully avoid entertaining a suspicion of another: For some suspicions are a crime. Inquire not too curiously into other mens failings: Neither let the one of you speak ill of another in his abscence. Would any of you desire to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely ye would abhor it. And fear God: For God is easy to be reconciled, and merciful"
