    "text": "O true believers, let not men laugh other men to scorn; who peradventure may be better than themselves: Neither let women laugh other women to scorn; who may possibly be better than themselves. Neither defame one another; nor call one another by opprobrious appellations. An ill name it is to be charged with wickedness, after having embraced the faith: And whoso repenteth not, they will be the unjust doers"
