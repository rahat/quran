He knoweth that there will be some infirm among you; and others travel through the earth, that they may obtain a competency of the bounty of God; and others fight in the defence of God's faith. Read, therefore, so much of the same as may be easy. And observe the stated times of prayer, and pay the legal alms; and lend unto God an acceptable loan; for whatever good ye send before for your souls, ye shall find the same with God. This will be better, and will merit a greater reward. And ask God forgiveness; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful"
