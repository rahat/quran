When Abraham said, my Lord is he who giveth life, and killeth: He answered, I give life, and I kill. Abraham said, verily God bringeth the sun from the east, now do thou bring it from the west. Whereupon the infidel was confounded; for God directeth not the ungoldly people"

He said, how shall God quicken this city, after she hath been dead? And God caused him to die for an hundred years, and afterwards raised him to life. And God said, how long hast thou tarried here? He answered, a day, or part of a day. God said, nay, thou hast tarried here an hundred years. Now look on thy food and thy drink, they are not yet corrupted; and look on thine ass: And this have we done that we might make thee a sign unto men. And look on the bones of thine ass, how we raise them, and afterwards cloath them with flesh. And when this was shewn unto him, he said, I know that God is able to do all things"
