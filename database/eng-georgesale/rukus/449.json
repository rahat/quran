Thou mayest see them bowing down, prostrate, seeking a recompense from God, and his good will. Their signs are in their faces, being marks of frequent prostration. This is their description in the pentateuch, and their description in the gospel: They are as seed which putteth forth its stalk, and strengtheneth it, and swelleth in the ear, and riseth upon its stem; giving delight unto the sower. Such are the Moslems described to be: That the infidels may swell with indignation at them. God hath promised unto such of them as believe, and do good works, pardon and a great reward"
