It is lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east, nor of the west: It wanteth little but that the oil thereof would give light, although no fire touched it. This is light added unto light: God will direct unto his light whom He pleaseth. God propoundeth parables unto men; for God knoweth all things"
