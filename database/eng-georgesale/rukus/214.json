Yet I had not any power over you to compel you; but I called you only, and ye answered me: Wherefore accuse not me, but accuse your selves. I cannot assist you; neither can ye assist me. Verily I do now renounce your having associated me with God heretofore. A grievous punishment is prepared for the unjust"
