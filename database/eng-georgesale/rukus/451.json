Neither defame one another; nor call one another by opprobrious appellations. An ill name it is to be charged with wickedness, after having embraced the faith: And whoso repenteth not, they will be the unjust doers"

Inquire not too curiously into other mens failings: Neither let the one of you speak ill of another in his abscence. Would any of you desire to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely ye would abhor it. And fear God: For God is easy to be reconciled, and merciful"
