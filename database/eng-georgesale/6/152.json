    "text": "And meddle not with the substance of the orphan, otherwise than for the improving thereof, until he attain his age of strength; and use a full measure, and a just balance. We will not impose a task on any soul, beyond its ability. And when ye pronounce judgement observe justice, although it be for or against one who is near of kin, and fulfill the covenant of God. This hath God commanded you, that ye may be admonished"
