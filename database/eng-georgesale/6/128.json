    "text": "Think on the day whereon God shall gather them all together, and shall say, O company of genii, ye have been much concerned with mankind; and their friends from among mankind shall say, O Lord, the one of us hath received advantage from the other, and we are arrived at our limited term which Thou hast appointed us. God will say, hell fire shall be your habitation, therein shall ye remain for ever; unless as God shall please to mitigate your pains, for thy Lord is wise and knowing"
