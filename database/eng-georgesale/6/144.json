    "text": "And of camels hath God given you one pair, and of oxen one pair. Say, hath He forbidden the two males of these, or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were ye present when God commanded you this? And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, that he may seduce men without understanding? Verily God directeth not unjust people"
