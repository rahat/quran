Say, 'Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and a guidance for the people -- though you treat it as scrapes of paper, some of which you show while you hide much thereof and you have been taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew?' Say, 'God.' Then leave them to amuse themselves with idle talk"
