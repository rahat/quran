    "text": "The idolaters will say, if God had pleased, we had not been guilty of idolatry, neither our fathers; and pretend that We have not forbidden them any thing.

Say, is there with you any certain knowledge of what ye alledge, that ye may produce it unto us? Ye follow only a false imagination; and ye only utter lies"
