    "text": "And fight in defence of God's true religion, as it behoveth you to fight for the same. He hath chosen you, and hath not imposed on you any difficulty in the religion which He hath given you, the religion of your father Abraham: He hath named you Moslems heretofore, and in this book; that our apostle may be a witness against you at the day of judgment, and that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind. Wherefore be ye constant at prayer; and give alms: And adhere firmly unto God. He is your master; and He is the best master, and the best protector"
