    "text": "Who have been turned out of their habitations injuriously, and for no other reason than because they say, our Lord is God. And if God did not repel the violence of some men by others, verily monasteries, and churches, and synagogues, and the temples of the Moslems, wherein the name of God is frequently commemorated, would be utterly demolished. And God will certainly assist him who shall be on his side: For God is strong and mighty"
