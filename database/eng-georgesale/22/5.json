    "text": "O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that We first created you of the dust of the ground; afterwards, of seed; afterwards, of a little coagulated blood; afterwards, of a piece of flesh, perfectly formed in part, and in part imperfectly formed; that We might make our power manifest unto you: And We cause that which We please to rest in the wombs, until the appointed time of delivery. Then We bring you forth infants; and afterwards We permit you to attain your age of full strength: And one of you dieth in his youth, and another of you is postponed to a decrepit age, so that he forgetteth whatever he knew. Thou seest the earth sometimes dried up and barren: But when We send down rain thereon, it is put in motion, and swelleth, and produceth every kind of luxuriant vegetables"
