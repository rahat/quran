Wherefore commemorate the name of God over them, when ye slay them, standing on their feet disposed in right order: And when they are fallen down dead, eat of them; and give to eat thereof both unto him who is content with what is given him, without asking, and unto him who asketh. Thus have We given you dominion over them, that ye might return Us thanks"
