    "text": "Hast thou not considered him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, my Lord is he who giveth life, and killeth: He answered, I give life, and I kill. Abraham said, verily God bringeth the sun from the east, now do thou bring it from the west. Whereupon the infidel was confounded; for God directeth not the ungoldly people"
