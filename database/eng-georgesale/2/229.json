    "text": "Ye may divorce your wives twice; and then either retain them with humanity, or dismiss them with kindness. But it is not lawful for you to take away any thing of what ye have given them, unless both fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God. And if ye fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God, it shall be no crime in either of them of account of that for which the wife shall redeem her self. These are the ordinances of God; therefore transgress them not; for whoever transgresseth the ordinances of God, they are unjust doers"
