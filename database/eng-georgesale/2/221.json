    "text": "Marry not women who are idolaters, until they believe: Verily a maid servant who believeth, is better than an idolatress, although she please you more. And give not women who believe, in marriage to the idolaters, until they believe; for verily a servant, who is a true believer, is better than an idolater, though he please you more. They invite unto hell fire, but God inviteth unto paradise and pardon through his will, and declareth his signs unto men, that they may remember"
