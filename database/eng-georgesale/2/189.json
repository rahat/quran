    "text": "They will ask thee concerning the phases of the moon: Answer, they are times appointed unto men, and to shew the season of the pilgrimage to Mecca. It is not righteousness that ye enter your houses by the back parts thereof, but righteousness is of him who feareth God. Therefore enter your houses by their doors; and fear God, that ye may be happy"
