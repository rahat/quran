    "text": "Perform the pilgrimage of Mecca, and the visitation of God: And if ye be besieged, send that offering which shall be the easiest; and shave not your heads, until your offering reacheth the place of sacrifice. But whoever among you is sick, or is troubled with any distemper of the head, must redeem the shaving his head by fasting, or alms, or some offering. When ye are secure from enemies, he who tarrieth in the visitation of the temple of Mecca until the pilgrimage, shall bring that offering which shall be the easiest. But he who findeth not any thing to offer, shall fast three days in the pilgrimage, and seven when ye are returned: They shall be ten days complete. This is incumbent on him, whose family shall not be present at the holy temple. And fear God and know that God is severe in punishing"
