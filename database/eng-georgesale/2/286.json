    "text": "God will not force any soul beyond its capacity: It shall have the good which it gaineth, and it shall suffer the evil which it gaineth. O Lord punisth us not, if we forget, or act sinfully: O Lord lay not on us a burden like that which thou hast laid on those who have been before us; neither make us, O Lord, to bear what we have not strength to bear, but be favourable unto us, and spare us, and be merciful unto us. Thou art our patron, help us therefore against the unbelieving nations"
