    "text": "O true believers, the law of retaliation is ordained you for the slain: The free shall die for the free, and the servant for the servant, and a woman for a woman: But he whom his brother shall forgive, may be prosecuted, and obliged to make satisfaction according to what is just, and a fine shall be set on him with humanity. This is indulgence from your Lord, and mercy. And he who shall transgress after this, by killing the murderer, shall suffer a grievous punishment"
