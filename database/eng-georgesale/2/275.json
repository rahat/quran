    "text": "They who devour usury shall not arise from the dead, but as he ariseth whom Satan hath infected by a touch: This shall happen to them because they say. Truly selling is but as usury: And yet God hath permitted selling and forbidden usury. He therefore who when there cometh unto him an admonition from his Lord, abstaineth from usury for the future, shall have what is past forgiven him, and his affair belongeth unto God. But whoever returneth to usury, they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall continue therein for ever"
