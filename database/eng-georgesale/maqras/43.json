But when ye shall have finished your pilgrimage; then hunt. And let not the malice of some, in that they hindered you from entering the sacred temple, provoke you to transgress, by taking revenge on them in the sacred months. Assist one another according to justice and piety, but assist not one another in injustice and malice: Therefore fear God; for God is severe in punishing"

It is likewise unlawful for you to make division by casting lots with arrows. This is an impiety. On this day, wo be unto those who have apostatized from their religion; therefore fear not them, but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have completed my mercy upon you; and I have chosen for you Islam, to be your religion. But whosoever shall be driven by necessity through hunger, to eat of what we have forbidden, not designing to sin, surely God will be indulgent and merciful unto him"
