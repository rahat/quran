Then We bring you forth infants; and afterwards We permit you to attain your age of full strength: And one of you dieth in his youth, and another of you is postponed to a decrepit age, so that he forgetteth whatever he knew. Thou seest the earth sometimes dried up and barren: But when We send down rain thereon, it is put in motion, and swelleth, and produceth every kind of luxuriant vegetables"
