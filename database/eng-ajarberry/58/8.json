    "text": "Hast thou not regarded those who were forbidden to converse secretly together, then they return to that they were forbidden, and they converse secretly together in sin and enmity, and in disobedience to the Messenger? Then, when they come to thee, they greet thee with a greeting God never greeted thee withal; and they say within themselves, 'Why does God not chastise us for what we say?' Sufficient for them shall be Gehenna, at which they, shall be roasted -- an evil homecoming"
