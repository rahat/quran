    "text": "If there were only some Quran by which the mountains would travel away or the earth would crack open, or the dead would speak out! Rather command is wholly God´s. Do not those who believe despair, because God might have guided all mankind had He so wished? Disaster will continually afflict those who disbelieve because of what they produce, or it will settle down close to their home until God´s promise comes true. God does not break any appointment"
