    "text": "God has sent down the finest report in a consistently duplicated Book. The skins of those who dread their Lord tingle with it; then their skins and hearts are softened up for remembering God. Such is GodÂ´s guidance; He guides anyone He wishes by means of it, while anyone whom God lets go astray will have no one to guide him"
