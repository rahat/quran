    "text": "Have you not watched those who have been told: \"Restrain your hands, keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax\"? Yet whenever any fighting is prescribed for them, then a group of them feel afraid of people just as they should be afraid of God, or they are even more afraid. They say: \"Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting for us? If You would only postpone it for a little while longer!\" * SAY: \"Worldly enjoyment means little while the Hereafter is better for anyone who does his duty. You will not be wronged a bit"
