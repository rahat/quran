    "text": "They will ask you for your verdict. SAY: \"God advises you (all) concerning indirect heirs. If some man should pass away and has no so while he leaves a sister, then she shall have half of anything he may leave while he inherits from her if she has no child. If they are two women [who are sisters], they shall both have two thirds of whatever he may leave. If they are siblings, both men and women.. then each brother shall have the same share as two sisters would have. God explains things to you lest you go astray. God is (all) Aware of everything"
