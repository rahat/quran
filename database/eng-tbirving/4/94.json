    "text": "You who believe, whenever you campaign for God´s sake, discriminate carefully and do not tell someone who proffers you a greeting: ´You are no believer!\" You crave the display of worldly life, while God holds many more prizes. That is what you were like previously, though God has showered His benefits on you; so discriminate. God is Informed about anything you do"
