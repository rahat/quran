    "text": "Those believers who sit around and yet have no physical disability are not equal to those who strive for GodÂ´s sake with their property and persons. God shows preference to those who strive with their property and persons through [higher] rank, than with those who just sit around; for each, God has promised handsome things, yet God shows preference to strivers with a better wage over those who stay at home"
