    "text": "Thus you told someone whom God had favored and whom you yourself have favored: \"Hold on to your wife, and heed God,\" while you kept to yourself what God had disclosed and you dreaded people[´s opinion], although it is more correct for you to dread God. Once Zayd had accomplished his purpose with her, We married her off to you so that there would be no objection for believers in respect to their adopted son´s wives once they have accomplished their purpose with them. God´s command must be done"
