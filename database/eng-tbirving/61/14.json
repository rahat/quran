    "text": "You who believe, act as God´s supporters just as Jesus the son of Mary told the disciples: \"Who will be my supporters [along the way] towards God?\" The disciples said: \"We are God´s supporters.\" A faction from the Children of Israel believed, while another faction disbelieved. We assisted the ones who believed against their enemy, till they held the upper hand"
