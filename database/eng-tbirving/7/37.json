Those will have their portion from the Book presented to them so that when Our messengers come to carry them off, they will say: Â´Where are whatever you used to appeal to instead of to God?\" They will say: \"They have left us in the lurch,\" and so they shall testify against themselves as to how they have been disbelievers"
