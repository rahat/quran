    "text": "We split them up into twelve tribes, communities, and inspired Moses when his people asked for water: ´Strike the rock with your staff.\" Twelve springs gushed forth from it. Each set of people knew its own drinking-place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down manna and quail for them: ´Eat some of the wholesome things which We have supplied you with.\" Yet they did not harm Us, but they themselves were the persons whom they harmed"
