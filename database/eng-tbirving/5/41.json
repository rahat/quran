    "text": "Messenger, do not let those who rush off into disbelief worry you, such as those who say: \"We believe\" with their mouths, while their hearts do not believe. Some of those are Jews who are listening for [the sake of] lying, listening for other folk who do not come to you. They lift words out of their context, saying: \"If you are given this, then take it; while if you are not given it, then watch out!\" God will never let you control someone whom God wants to test in any way; those are the ones whose hearts God does not want to purify. They will have disgrace in this world, while in the Hereafter they will have terrible punishment"
