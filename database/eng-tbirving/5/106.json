    "text": "You who believe, testimony should be taken by you whenever death appears for one of you; at the time for drawing up any will, two of you who are fair-minded, or two others besides yourselves if you are travelling around the earth and the calamity of death should strike you. Detain them both after prayer so they may swear by God if you (all) have any doubts \"We will not sell it for any price, not even to a near relative, nor will we hide GodÂ´s testimony: otherwise we would be sinners"
