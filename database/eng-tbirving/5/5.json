    "text": "Today wholesome things are [made] lawful for you, and so is the food of those who were given the Book lawful for you, while your food is lawful them. And believing matrons [are lawful to marry] as well as matrons from among those who were given the Book before you, once you have given them their marriage- portions and taken them in wedlock respectably, not seeking any thrills nor taking [them on as] mistresses. Anyone who rejects faith [will find] his action will miscarry, while he will be one who will lose out in the Hereafter"
