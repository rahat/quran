    "text": "God confirmed His promise to you as you grappled with them by His permission, until you faltered and argued about the matter; you disobeyed after He had shown you what you would love (to have). Some of you want this world, while others of you want the Hereafter. Then he diverted you from them so He might test you. Yet He has overlooked it in you; God possesses bounty for believers"
