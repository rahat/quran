    "text": "You who believe, do not be like those who disbelieve and tell their brethren when they travel around the earth or are out on some campaign: \"If they had been with us, they would not have died nor been killed,\" so that God places that [sort of] despair in their hearts. God gives life and brings death; God is Observant of anything you do"
