    "text": "as a messenger to the Children of Israel: ´I have brought you a sign from your Lord. I shall create something in the shape of a bird for you out of clay, and blow into it so it will become a [real] bird with God´s permission. I shall cure those who are blind from birth and lepers, and revive the dead with God´s permission. I shall announce to you what you may eat and what you should store up in your houses. That will serve as a sign for you if you are believers"
