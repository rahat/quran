They said: \"Is this a concern of ours in any way?\" SAY: \"The whole concern is up to God.\" They hide something they do not show in their souls; they say: \"If we had had anything to do with the matter, we would not have had to fight here.\" SAY: \"Even though you were in your own homes, those for whom killing has been prescribed would have shown up on their deathbeds, so that God might test what is on your minds and purge whatever is in your hearts. God is Aware of whatever is on your minds"
