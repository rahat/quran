Eat and drink until the white streak [of dawn] can be distinguished by you from the black thread [of night] at daybreak. Then complete the Fast until nightfall and have no dealings with women while you are secluded at your devotions in the mosques. Such are God´s limits, so do not attempt to cross them! Thus God explains His signs to mankind so they may do their duty"
