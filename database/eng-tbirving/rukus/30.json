It is not lawful for you to take anything you have given any women unless both parties fear they will not keep within God´s limits. If you fear they will not keep within God´s limits, then there is no blame on either of them if she buys him off. Such are God´s limits, so do not exceed them; those who exceed God´s limits are wrongdoers"

Remember God´s favor towards you, and anything He has sent down to you out of the Book and wisdom for your instruction. Heed God and know that God is Aware of everything"
