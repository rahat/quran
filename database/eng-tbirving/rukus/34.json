When he and those who were along with him and believed had crossed over, they said: \"We have no way today to prevail over Goliath and his troops!\" Those who thought they were going to meet God said: \"How often has a small detachment defeated a larger detachment with God´s permission! God stands alongside the patient"

If God had wished, they would not have fallen out with one another, but God does whatever He wants"
