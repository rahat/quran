    "text": "You who believe, whenever believing women come to you as refugees, examine them. God is quite Aware of their faith, so if you recognize them to be believing women, do not send them back to the disbelievers; such women are not lawful for them nor are such men lawful for such women. Give [their former husbands] whatever they may have spent [on them]. There is no objection if you marry such women off, once you give them their allotments. Do not hold on to. any ties with disbelievers; ask for whatever you may have spent and let them ask for what they have spent. Such is GodÂ´s discretion; He will settle things between you. God is Aware, Wise"
