With those He will engrave faith on their hearts, assist them with a spirit from Himself, and will show them into gardens through which rivers flow, to live there forever. God will approve of them while they will be pleased with Him. Those are on God´s side. God´s party are those who shall be successful"

You (all) did not think that they would leave, while they thought that their strongholds would keep God away from them. Yet God came at them from where they did not anticipate it and cast such panic into their hearts, that they tore their houses down with their own hands as well as through believers´ hands: so learn a lesson, you who have any insight"
