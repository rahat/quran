Do not retain them just to act mean with them; anyone who does that merely hurts himself. Do not take God´s signs as a joke! Remember God´s favor towards you, and anything He has sent down to you out of the Book and wisdom for your instruction. Heed God and know that God is Aware of everything"

Whoever among you believes in God and the Last Day is instructed to act thus; that is purer for you as well as more orderly. God knows while you do not know [what is fitting]"

Yet no person is charged with more than he can cope with. No mother should be made to suffer because of her child, nor family head because of his child. An heir has the same [duties] in that respect. If they both prefer to wean [the child] when they have agreed terms and consulted together, it should not be held against them; so if you want to find a wetnurse for your children, it should not be held against you, provided you hand over whatever you may have given in all decency. Heed God and know that God is Observant of anything you do"
