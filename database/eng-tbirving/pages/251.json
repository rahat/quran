An appeal by disbelievers merely goes astray"

The torrent carries along swelling foam, foam just like what comes out of fire they have kindled to smelt jewelry or some equipment with. Even so God knocks Truth and falsehood together [to compare them]. As for the foam, the scum will go away; while whatever benefits mankind lingers on in the earth, Thus God compares things with one another"
