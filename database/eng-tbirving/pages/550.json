Give [their former husbands] whatever they may have spent [on them]. There is no objection if you marry such women off, once you give them their allotments. Do not hold on to. any ties with disbelievers; ask for whatever you may have spent and let them ask for what they have spent. Such is GodÂ´s discretion; He will settle things between you.
