Solomon did not disbelieve but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and what was sent down to Harut and Marut, two angels at Babylon. Neither of these would teach anyone unless they [first] said: \"We are only a temptation, so do not disbelieve!\" They learned from them both what will separate a man from his wife. Yet they do not harm anyone through it except with God´s permission. They learn what will harm them and does not benefit them. They know that anyone who deals in it will have no share in the Hereafter; how wretched is what they have sold themselves for, if they only knew"
