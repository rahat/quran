    "text": "SAY: Â´Come close, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you: Do not associate anything with Him; And [show] kindness towards both [your] parents. Do not kill your children because of poverty; We shall provide for as well as for them. Do not indulge in shocking acts which you may practice either openly or keep secret. Do not kill any person whom God has forbidden, except through [due process of] law. He has instructed you in this so that you may use your reason"
