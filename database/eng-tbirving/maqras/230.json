God measures out both night and daylight; He knows that you (all) will never count them up, so He has relented towards you. Read whatever seems feasible from the Quran. He knows that some of you may be ill while others are out travelling around the earth seeking God´s bounty, and still others are fighting for God´s sake. So read any of it that seems feasible, and keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, and advance God a handsome loan. Anything good you send on ahead for yourselves, you will find [later on] with God; it is better and more important as earnings. Seek forgiveness from God; God will be Forgiving, Merciful"
