    "text": "You should have seen how the sun as it rose, swerved away from their Cave toward the right; and as it set, slanted off toward the left of them, while they lay in a space in between. That was one of GodÂ´s signs. Anyone whom God guides, remains guided; while anyone He lets go astray will never find any patron to set him straight"
