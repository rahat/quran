    "text": "He is the One Who turned those People of the Book who disbelieved, out of their homes in the first banishment. You (all) did not think that they would leave, while they thought that their strongholds would keep God away from them. Yet God came at them from where they did not anticipate it and cast such panic into their hearts, that they tore their houses down with their own hands as well as through believersÂ´ hands: so learn a lesson, you who have any insight"
