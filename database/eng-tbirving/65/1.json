    "text": "O Prophet, whenever you [and other Muslims] d i v o r c e women, send them away according to their [legal] number and count up the amount [of months carefully], and heed God your Lord. Do not turn them out of their homes, nor should they be forced to leave except when they have committed some flagrant act of sexual misconduct. Such are God´s limits, and anyone who oversteps God´s limits thereby harms himself. You do not know whether God may let some matter happen later on"
