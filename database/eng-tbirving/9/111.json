    "text": "God has bought up their persons and their property from believers, so they may have the Garden [instead). They fight for GodÂ´s sake; they kill and are killed as a rightful promise from Him [to be found] in the Old Testament, the Gospel and the Quran. Who is more Trustworthy with His word than God? So rejoice in your bargain which you have reached with Him. That will be the supreme Achievement"
