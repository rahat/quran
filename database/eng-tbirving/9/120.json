    "text": "It is not for the people of Medina nor any desert Arabs who (live) around them, to lag behind God´s messenger nor to prefer themselves ahead of himself. That is so no thirst would afflict them, nor any stress nor starvation along God´s way, nor would they adopt any stand which irritate disbelievers, nor gain any acquisition from an enemy, unless some honorable action were recorded for them because of it. God does not waste the wages of those who act kindly"
