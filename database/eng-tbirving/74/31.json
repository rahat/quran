    "text": "We have placed none but angels as guardians of the Fire. We have placed such a number merely as a test for those who disbelieve, to convince the ones who have been given the Book, while those who believe may be increased in [their] faith; and so the ones who have been given the Book as well as believers may not doubt, while the ones in whose hearts there lurks mahce, as well as disbelievers will say: \"What does God want to compare this to ?\" Thus God lets anyone He wishes go astray while He guides whomever He wishes. No one knows your LordÂ´s armies except He Himself. It is only a Reminder for humanity"
