    "text": "Strive for GodÂ´ sake, the way He should be striven for. He has picked you out and has not placed any constraint upon you concerning [your] religion, the sect of your forefather Abraham. He has named you Muslims both previously and right now, so the Messenger may be a witness for you, and you may act as witnesses for mankind. Keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, and cling firmly to God; He is your Protector. What a splendid Protector, and what a splendid Supporter"
