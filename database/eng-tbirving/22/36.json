    "text": "Animals´ bodies [to be sacrificed] We have granted to you as some of God´s symbols. They contain good for you, so mention God´s name over them as they are lined up [for slaughter]. Once they slump down on their sides, then eat some of them and feed both the [poor man who is] carefree and the one who insists on it. Thus We have subjected them to you so that you may be thankful"
