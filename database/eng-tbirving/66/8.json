    "text": "You who believe, turn to God in frank repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remit your evil deeds for you and show you into gardens through which rivers flow, on a day when God will not let the Prophet be humiliated. Those who believe will stand alongside him, their light streaming on ahead of them and to their right. They will say: \"Our Lord, perfect our light for us, and forgive us! You are Capable of everything"
