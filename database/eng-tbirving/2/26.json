    "text": "God does not hesitate to compare things to a mosquito nor to anything bigger than it. Those who believe realize that it is the Truth from their Lord, while those who disbelieve say: \"What does God want in such a comparison?\" He lets so many go astray through it, and guides many by means of it. Yet only immoral persons are led astray by it"
