Our Lord, do not take us to task if we have forgotten or slipped up! Our Lord, do not lay any obligation us such as You placed on those before us. Our Lord, do not overburden us with more than we can bear! Pardon us, forgive us, and show us mercy! You are our Protector, so support us against disbelieving folk"
