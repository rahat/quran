    "text": "God! There is no deity except Him, the Living, the Eternal! Slumber does not overtake Him, nor does sleep. What the Heavens hold and what Earth holds [belongs] to Him. Who is there to intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what lies before them and whatÂ´s behind them, while they embrace nothing of His knowledge except whatever He may wish. His Seat extends far over Heaven and Earth; preserving them both does not overburden Him. He is the Sublime, the Almighty"
