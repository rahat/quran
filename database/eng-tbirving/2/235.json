    "text": "It should not be held against you concerning whatever you propose in the way of becoming engaged to such women, or may keep yourselves; God knows that you will bear them in mind. However do not propose anything to them secretly unless you utter a formal statement. Do not tie the marriage knot until the decree has become final; know that God knows whatever is on your minds, so be careful with Him! Know that God is Forgiving, Lenient"
