    "text": "Divorce may be [pronounced] twice; then [it means] either to retain [your mate] in all decency, or else part from [the other partner] with (all) kindness. It is not lawful for you to take anything you have given any women unless both parties fear they will not keep within God´s limits. If you fear they will not keep within God´s limits, then there is no blame on either of them if she buys him off. Such are God´s limits, so do not exceed them; those who exceed God´s limits are wrongdoers"
