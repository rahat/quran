    "text": "Those who live off the interest on loans will never stand up, except in the way those whom Satan knocks down with a fit rise up again. That is because they say: \"Trading is just like taking interest.\" Yet God has permitted trading and forbidden taking interest. Anyone who receives such an instruction from his Lord and stops doing so, may keep whatever [capital] is a thing of the past, while his case rests with God; yet those who do so over and over again will become inmates of the Fire, to remain the forever"
