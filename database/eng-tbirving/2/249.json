    "text": "When Saul set out with the troops, he said: \"God will test you at a river: anyone who drinks from it will not be on my side; while anyone who does not taste it is with me, except for someone who scoops up only a palmful in his hand.\" Yet all but a few of them drank some of it! When he and those who were along with him and believed had crossed over, they said: \"We have no way today to prevail over Goliath and his troops!\" Those who thought they were going to meet God said: \"How often has a small detachment defeated a larger detachment with GodÂ´s permission! God stands alongside the patient"
