    "text": "A man from Pharaoh´s court who was a believer and had hiding his faith said: \"What, will you kill a man for merely saying: ´My Lord is God´? He has brought you explanations about your Lord. If he is a liar, then his lie falls upon himself, while if he is truthful, some of what he threatens you with will afflict you. God does not guide anyone who is a preposterous liar"
