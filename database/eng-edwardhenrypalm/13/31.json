    "text": "And though it were a Qur'an by which the mountains were moved, or by which the earth were cut up, or the dead made to speak - nay, God's is the command altogether! Did not those who believed know that if God had pleased He would have guided men altogether? And a striking calamity shall not cease to overtake those who misbelieve for what they have wrought, or to alight close by their dwellings; until God's promise comes - verily, God fails not in His promise"
