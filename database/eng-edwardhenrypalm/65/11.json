God has sent down to you a reminder; - an apostle to recite to you God's manifest signs;- to bring forth those who believe and act aright from darkness into light! and whoso believes in God and acts right He will bring him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever and for aye! God has made goodly for him his provision"
