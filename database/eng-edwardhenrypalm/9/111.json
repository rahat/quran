    "text": "Verily, God hath bought of the believers their persons and their wealth, for the paradise they are to have; they shall fight in the way of God, and they shall slay and be slain: promised in truth, in the law and the gospel and the Qur'an;- and who is more faithful to His covenant than God ? Be ye glad then in the covenant which ye have made with Him, for that is the mighty happiness"
