    "text": "They swear by God they did not speak it, but they did speak the word of misbelief; and they disbelieved after they had embraced Islam, and they designed what they could not attain; and they only disapproved it because God and His Apostle had enriched them of His grace. If they turn again 'tis better for them; but if they turn their backs, God will torment them with mighty woe in this world and in the next, nor shall they have upon the earth a patron or protector"
