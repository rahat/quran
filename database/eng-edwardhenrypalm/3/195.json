    "text": "And the Lord shall answer them, 'I waste not the works of a worker amongst you, be it male or female,- one of you is from the other. 'Those who fled, and were turned out of their houses, and were harmed in my way, and who fought and were killed, I will cover their offences, and I will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow.' A reward from God; for God, with Him are the best of rewards"
