    "text": "O ye who believe! when ye rise up to prayer wash your faces, and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe - your heads, and your feet down to the ankles. And if ye are polluted, then purify yourselves. But if ye are sick, or on a journey, or if one of you comes from the privy, or if ye have touched women and cannot find water, then take fine surface sand and wipe your faces and your hands therewith. God does not wish to make any hindrance for you; but he wishes to purify you and to fulfill his favour upon you; haply ye may give thanks"
