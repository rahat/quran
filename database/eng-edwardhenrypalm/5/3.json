    "text": "Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is devoted to other than God, and the strangled and the knocked down, and that which falls down, and the gored, and what wild beasts have eaten - except what ye slaughter in time - and what is sacrificed to idols, and dividing carcases by arrows. Today shall those who disbelieve in your religion despair; do ye not then fear them, but fear me - Today is perfected for you your religion, and fulfilled upon you is my favour, and I am pleased for you to have Islam for a religion. But he who is forced by hunger, not inclined willfully to sin, verily, God is forgiving, compassionate"
