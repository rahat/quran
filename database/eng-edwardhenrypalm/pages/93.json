But if he be from a tribe hostile to you and yet a believer, then let him free a believing neck. And if it be a tribe betwixt whom and you there is an alliance, then let the blood-money be paid to his friends, and let him free a believing neck; but he who cannot find the means, then let him fast for two consecutive months - a penance this from God, for God is knowing, wise"

So were ye aforetime, but God was gracious to you, be ye then discerning; verily, God of what ye do is well aware"
