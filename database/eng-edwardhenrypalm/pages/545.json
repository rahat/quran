He has written faith in their hearts, and He aids them with a spirit from Him; and will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye! God is well pleased with them, and they well pleased with Him: they are God's crew; ay, God's crew, they shall prosper"

They ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers; wherefore take example, O ye who are endowed with sight"
