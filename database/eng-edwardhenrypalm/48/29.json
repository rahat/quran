    "text": "Mohammed is the Apostle of God, and those who are with Him are vehement against the misbelievers,- compassionate amongst themselves; thou mayest see them bowing down, adoring, craving grace from God and His goodwill,- their marks are in their faces from the effects of adoration;- that is their similitude in the law and their similitude in the gospel; as a seedling puts forth its sprouts and strengthens it, and grows stout, and straightens itself upon its stem, delighting the sower!- that the misbelievers may be angry at them;- God has promised those of them who believe and do right - forgiveness and a mighty hire"
