    "text": "It is not for a believer to kill a believer save by mistake; and whosoever kills a believer by mistake then let him free a believing neck; and the blood-money must be paid to his people save what they shall remit as alms. But if he be from a tribe hostile to you and yet a believer, then let him free a believing neck. And if it be a tribe betwixt whom and you there is an alliance, then let the blood-money be paid to his friends, and let him free a believing neck; but he who cannot find the means, then let him fast for two consecutive months - a penance this from God, for God is knowing, wise"
