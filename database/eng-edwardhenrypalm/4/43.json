    "text": "O ye who believe! approach not prayer while ye are drunk, until ye well know what ye say; nor yet while polluted,- unless ye be passing by the way,- until ye have washed yourselves. But if ye are sick, or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or if ye have touched a woman, and ye cannot find water, then use good surface sand and wipe your faces and your hands therewith; verily, God pardons and forgives"
