I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you, that ye may not associate aught with Him, and (may show) kindness to your parents, and not kill your children through poverty;- we will provide for you and them;- and draw not nigh to flagrant sins, either apparent or concealed, and kill not the soul, which God hath forbidden save by right; that is what God ordains you, haply ye may understand"
