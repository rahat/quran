    "text": "Say: “Shall we invoke besides Allah what gives not benefit to us and nor gives us hurt; and (thus) we may be turned on our heels after when Allah has guided us — like that whom the devils on the earth have made go astray, in confusion. For him are companions (and colleagues): they call him to the guidance (saying) ‘come to us’.” Say: “Verily Allah’s Guidance! That is the True Guidance, and we have been commanded that we may submit (in Islam) to the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds.”"
