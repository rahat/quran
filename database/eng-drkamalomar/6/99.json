We bring forth, from it, grain, thickly clustered. And out of the date-palm â€” from its spathe (come forth) clusters (of dates) hanging low and near, and orchards of grapes, and olive and pomegranate, similar and (also) not similar (in appearance, size, shape and taste). Look, you people to its fruit when it brought (its) fruit and (also at the) ripeness thereof. Definitely, in this, to you, (are) sure signs for the nation who Believe (in One God)"
