    "text": "And the Day He gathers them all together (saying): “O you assembly of jinns! Surely you exceeded (in gaining victims) from mankind.” And their ‘auliya’ from mankind said: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Some of us benefited from some (others) and we reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.” (Allah) said: “The Fire (be) your dwelling place. (You would be) dwellers therein except what Allah willed. Certainly your Nourisher-Sustainer is All-Wise, All-Aware.”"
