    "text": "And they said: “Such and such cattle and crop are forbidden. None shall eat them except whom we desire,” ( — and this they said) on the basis of their concocted beliefs. And (there are) cattle — their backs have been made (by them) forbidden (to carry any loads); and (there are) cattle they do not pronounce the Name of Allah over them (as they believe that it is forbidden to slaughter them or to eat their flesh) lying against Him (as they invent these lies in the name of religion). Soon He will recompense them (with due punishment) for what they used to fabricate"
