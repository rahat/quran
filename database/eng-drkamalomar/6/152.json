We burden not any Nafs except to her capacity. And when you gave a statement, then you stick to justice even if (the accused) happened to be (your) near relative and be fully sincere with the covenant of Allah (to which a person is attached if he or she is a Muslim). This (is something) He advised you about this, so that you may remind and be reminded"
