    "text": "Say: “I do not find in that what has been inspired to me a forbidden item to (any) consumer who eats it except that it becomes (meat of) dead (animal), or blood which has gushed out (or poured forth from the organs and tissues of an animal slaughtered or killed by shooting), or the flesh of swine (like pork and ham etc.), for surely that is Rijs or Fisq (what has been) pronounced for / dedicated to other than Allah, alongwith Him. So whoever became helpless — not (being) wilfully disobedient and neither (being) one who knowingly breaks the limits — then surely your Nourisher-Sustainer is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
