    "text": "So whomsoever Allah intends that He may guide him He releases his chest (i.e., He unlocks his heart) for (the understanding, acceptance and adoption of) Islam. And whosoever He intends that He may send him astray, He will make his chest constricted and heavy as if he is rising towards the sky. Thus Allah imposes Ar-Rijs on those who do not Believe (in Islam â€” in accordance with the teachings in Al-Kitab)"
