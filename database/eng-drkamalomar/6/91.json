    "text": "And they did not estimate Allah with an estimation due to Him when they said: “Allah has not delivered to a human being any thing (as an Instruction Manual).” Say: “Who delivered Al-Kitab with which approached Musa — (which acts as) a Light and Guidance to Mankind? You people have broken it into separate papersheets — you make evident (some of) it and you hide a major portion (thereof). And you were taught (through it) what you knew not — (neither) you and nor your fathers.” (Now in reply to the question put up by you), say: “Allah (delivered Al-Kitab to Musa)!” Then leave them, they will play and amuse through their vain discussion"
