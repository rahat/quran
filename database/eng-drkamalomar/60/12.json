When Believing females have reached you— these women give you a pledge over — that they shall not set anything to be in partnership with Allah, and they shall not commit theft, and they shall not indulge in Zina and they shall not slay their offsprings, and they shall not approach with a slander which they shall falsely implicate (to the womb) between their hands and their legs, and shall not disobey you in desirable (ordainments and verdicts) — then accept their pledge and ask Allah for their forgiveness. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
