    "text": "O you who have Believed! Pick up not My enemies and your enemies as auliya; you approach them with affection while indeed they have disbelieved in what came to you of Al-Haqq. They drive out the Messenger as well as you (Muslims) since you Believe in Allah — Nourisher-Sustainer to you. If you happened: you moved out striving in My Cause, and seehead of state My agreements — (yet) you secretly move towards them with affection, and I do know with what you kept secret, and what you made evident. And whoever commits that from amongst you — then indeed he has lost the rightness of the Path"
