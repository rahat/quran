    "text": "O you who have Believed! Al-Qisas is prescribed to you in murders. (Kill) the free when the killer happens to be the free, and the bondman when he is a bondman, and the woman when (the killer) is the woman. But who has forgiven something on his (victim’s) behalf to his brother (i.e., to the killer), then fulfil (it) in a desirable way and compensate him with gratitude. This is a concession and mercy from your Nourisher-Sustainer. After this whoever committed any transgression — so, for him, is a penalty most grievous"
