    "text": "And the women on whom divorce has been pronounced shall wait concerning themselves for three menstrual flows. And it is not lawful for them that they may conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they happen to Believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have a better right to take them back (as wives) during this (waiting period) if they intended for reconciliation. And in the interest of those women (are rights for honourable residence and living expenses and personality-protection) similar to those imposed on these women (that they would obey their husbands, respect him and exclusively guard their own chastity) â€” (all) in a most desirable way. And for men, in comparison to these women, is one point (being Qawwam of the family unit, and having a right of rejoining with the wife during the waiting period). And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
