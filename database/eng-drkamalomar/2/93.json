    "text": "And when We took your covenant and We slided over you the mount (saying): “Hold firmly to what We have given you (in Al-Kitab) and listen to (Our words).” They said: “We have heard and disobeyed.” And because of their disbelief the young of the cow was allowed to be absorbed in their hearts. Say: “Bad is that which your faith enjoins on you if you are Believers.”"
