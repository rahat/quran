    "text": "They ask you about periods (in women — their menstruations). Say: “It is a state of injury (damage to the tissues). So avoid (sexual approach to) women during menstruations and do not approach them (for mahead of state sexual relations) until these women have become free (of menses). Then when they have cleansed themselves (at the cessation of their menstruation), approach them from where Allah has ordained you (in the coming Verse). Verily, Allah loves those who turn (to Him) constantly, and loves those who keep themselves clean and pure"
