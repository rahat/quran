    "text": "And when you divorced women (on your initiatives, against their desires) and they have reached the term prescribed to them (as iddat, and the marriage-bond gets broken), then do not prevent them if they marry their husbands (who have divorced these women) when they have made agreement between themselves in an honourable way. This, He propounds with for the one amongst you who Believes in Allah and the Last Day. This to you is more pious to you and more sanctified. And Allah knows and you do not know"
