    "text": "And they accepted (without investigation) what the satans propagated against the empire of Sulaiman (Solomon), although Sulaiman did no blasphemy, rather the devils rejected (the Original). They teach magic to people and what was delivered at Babel (Babylon) to two angels - Harut and Marut. And these two provided no knowledge (to counteract magic) to any one till the twain warned: “We are on trial, so do not blaspheme (by misusing this knowledge).” Then they gain knowledge from the two by which they cause separation between man and his wife. And they could not thus harm any one except by Allah’s permission. And they are learning which harms them and does not benefit them. And they certainly knew that whoever purchased this (magic) would have no happiness in the Hereafter. And filthy it is for which they have sold their selves, if they had been knowing (the punishment)"
