    "text": "And when you have divorced women (on your own initiatives, against the desire of the wife) and they have completed the period prescribed to them (as iddat), then take them back on equitable terms or let them go on honourable terms. And you shall not take them back to torture them or to take undue advantage. And whosoever does this — then certainly he has wronged his own self. And do not ridicule Allah’s statements. And bring to mind Allah’s grace on you and whatever He delivered to you as Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah. He guides you through it. And pay obedience to Allah and beware that verily, Allah is Aware of every thing"
