    "text": "Those Messengers, We gifted some of them over and above others: out of them is, whom Allah spoke (direct), some of them He raised in degrees: and to Iesa, son of Maryam, We gave Al-Bayyinat and We strengthened him with Ruh-ul-Qudus. And if Allah had so willed the succeeding generations would not have fought amongst each other, after Al-Bayyinat had come to them. But they differed in interpretation. So some of them Believed and some of them rejected. And if Allah had so willed they would not have fought each other. But Allah does what He thinks proper"
