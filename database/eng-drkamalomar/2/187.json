    "text": "Has been made lawful to you, during the night of the Fasts the sexual approach to your wives. They are a garment to you and you are a garment to them. Allah knew that you: you continued to curtail from the rights of yourselves, so He turned in attention to you and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek (the pleasure or progeny) whatever Allah has written for you. And continue to eat and drink until becomes evident to you the white linear area from the dark linear area (on the sky) at the break of dawn. Then complete the fasts till it is night (and the sun is no more visible). And do not have sexual relations with them while you are in Itikaf in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so donâ€™t stand at its edge. Thus Allah explains His statements for mankind so that they may become Al-Muttaqun"
