    "text": "The month of Ramazan, in which is sent down Al-Quran, a Guidance for mankind, and clear proofs for the guidance and Al-Furqan. So one of you who has witnessed the month must pass it in fasting. And who became sick or is in travel â€” then the prescribed period (is to be completed) from days later. Allah desires ease for you, He does not intend difficulty for you; and that you shall complete the prescribed number, and that you may glorify Allah realising that He has guided you and that you may pay thanks"
