    "text": "Allah! La-ilaha-illa-Huwa, Ever-Alive, Eternal. Slumber does not overpower Him, and nor sleep. To Him owes existence whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedes with Him except under His permission? He knows whatever is in their two hands and whatever is behind them. They shall not grasp any thing out of His knowledge except whatever He permitted. His dominion extends and covers the heavens and the earth. The maintenance of these two brings Him no fatigue. And He is the Most High, the Supreme"
