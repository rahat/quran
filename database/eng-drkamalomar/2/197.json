    "text": "The Hajj (is in the) well known (last three) months (of the lunar year). So one who makes therein Hajj compulsory on himself â€” then during Hajj there shall be no Rafus (indulging in sex), and no Fusuq (acts of wickedness and disobedience) and no Jidal (involvement in disputes, arguments or fights). And whatever good you do, Allah knows it, and do take a provision (for the Hajj-journey) and verily, the best of provision is At-Taqwa. And pay obedience to Me, O men of understanding"
