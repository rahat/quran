    "text": "And those amongst you who are made to die and leave behind wives â€” these women shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days. Then, when they have completed their prescribed waiting period, there is no blame on you people for what these women do in the interest of their ownselves (like arranging another marriage) in a desirable way. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do"
