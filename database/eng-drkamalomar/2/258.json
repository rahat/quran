When Ibrahim said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer is That Who gives life and He brings death.” (The ruler) said: “I give life and I give death.\" Ibrahim said: “So, certainly, Allah comes with the sun from the East. So do come you, with it, from the West!” Thus was made stunned who had rejected and disbelieved. And Allah does not guide the nation of transgressors"
