    "text": "Those who devour Riba (usury) will not stand except as stands that whom the Satan by (his) touch makes devoid of intelligence. This is because they said: “Indeed! Even trade is similar to Riba.” Although Allah has permitted trade and has prohibited Riba. Then, to whom the Admonition came from his Nourisher-Sustainer and he desisted, then is (for and) to him whatever is past and his case (goes) to Allah (for decision). And one who repeated, then those are dwellers of Fire, they will reside therein"
