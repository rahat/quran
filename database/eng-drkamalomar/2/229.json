    "text": "Such a divorce is permissible twice: after that either a permanent stay together, or a separation with kindness. And it is not lawful to you that you may retain anything out of what you have given to these women (any time in married life) except when a (particular) pair apprehends that the pair can not honour the conditions ordained by Allah (as the requirements of a married life). Then if you feared that these two would not abide by the ordainments of Allah, then there is no sin on (either of) these two in what she (i.e., the wife) paid to him (i.e., the husband) as ransom to this (pronouncement of divorce by husband against his will, only on wifeâ€™s initiative). These are the limits set by Allah, then override them not. And one who overrides the limits set by Allah, then such are those who are transgressors"
