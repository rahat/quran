    "text": "After this, it is you who kill your own people and you turn out a group of your own from their houses; you assist (their enemies) against them in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives (having been kidnapped) you demand ransom (for their release), although this, their expulsion, was forbidden to you. Then do you Believe in a portion of Al-Kitab and you disbelieve in the rest? Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in immediate life, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the more grievous punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do"
