    "text": "Allah does not burden a soul except to its capacity. To her favour whatever (good) she has earned, and against her whatever (evil) she has earned. (Closing words for this Surah are): “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Do not catch us if we forgot or made mistake, our Nourisher-Sustainer! And lay not on us a burden as you did lay on those before us, our Nourisher-Sustainer! And load us not that for which we have no strength and write off from us (our sins), and grant us forgiveness and have mercy on us. You are Protector for us, so help us against the nation of disbelievers.”"
