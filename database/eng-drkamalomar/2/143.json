    "text": "And thus We evolved you as an ideal Ummah so that you become witnesses over mankind and the Messenger becomes a witness over you. And We did not prescribe the Qiblah which you patronise except that We might know who copies the Messenger, from that who turns away upon his two heels. And certainly it is extremely hard except for those whom Allah has guided. And Allah would never be one who may make your faith of no effect. Verily Allah is Full of Kindness, continuously Merciful to mankind"
