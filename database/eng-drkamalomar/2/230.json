    "text": "So if (in such a case the woman pays ransom and only then) he divorced her, then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married a husband other than him. Then, if (this other husband) divorced her, then there is no obstruction for these two (i.e., the woman and her first husband) if they approach each other (for a new marriage between themselves), provided both are certain that both will abide the ordainments of Allah. And these are the limits set by Allah. He explains them for the people who have knowledge"
