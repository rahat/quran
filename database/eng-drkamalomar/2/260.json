Don’t you Believe?” (Ibrahim) said: “Definitely (I Believe, but) so that my heart feels satisfaction.” (Allah) said: \"Take four, out of the birds; then train them to return to you (on your call). Then put, on every hill, out of these (four ones) a portion (thereof). Then give them a call, they will come to you (flying) with speed. And know that Allah is Exalted in Power, Ever-Wise.”"
