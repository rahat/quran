    "text": "And do not marry Al-Mushrikat till they Believe. A bond-woman who is a Believer is better than a Mushrikah even if she allured you. And do not give (your girls) in marriage to Al-Mushrikun till they Believe (in One God only). And surely a bond-man who is a Believer (in One God) is better than a Mushrik even if he has allured you. They invite you to the Fire while Allah invites to the Bliss and Forgiveness by His Leave. And He explains His Ayaat to mankind so that they may propagate the Message"
