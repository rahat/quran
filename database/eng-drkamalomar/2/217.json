    "text": "They ask you concerning the Shahr-al-Haram, (regarding) Qital therein. Say: “Qital therein is a grave (offence); but to prevent from the Way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid-al-Haram, and to drive out its people from it — (are) greater (sins) in the Sight of Allah. And tumult and oppression are worse than murder. And they will not cease mahead of state war with you until they turn you away from your Religion if they could. And whoever amongst you who leaves his Religion and dies while he is a disbeliever — then these are those whose deeds became of no use in the world as well as in the Hereafter, and they are the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein"
