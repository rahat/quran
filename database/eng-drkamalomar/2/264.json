    "text": "O you people who have Believed! Do not make of no effect your Sadaqat by reminders of generosity or acts of insult: like that who spends his wealth to be seen of men and he does not Believe in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is dust; on it fell heavy rain which left it bare. They will not be able to utilize anything out of what they earned. And Allah guides not the nation of disbelievers"
