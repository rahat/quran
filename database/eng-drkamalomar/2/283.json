    "text": "And if you are in travel and you find not a scribe, then mortgage (something) in custody. And if some of you relied on some other, then he must return who has been trusted by that to whom belongs the item (loaned). And he must pay obedience to Allah, his Nourisher-Sustainer. And do not conceal the evidence. And whoever conceals it, then indeed he: his heart (is) a sinner. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
