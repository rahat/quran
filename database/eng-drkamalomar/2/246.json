    "text": "Have you not looked towards the chiefs of the progeny of Israiel after (the time of) Musa when they said to a Prophet (appointed) over them: “Appoint for us an administrative head of state, we will do Qital in the cause of Allah.” (Their Prophet) said: “Would it happen with you that Qital is ordained on you (and) that you do not do Qital?” They said: “And what is with us that we do not make Qital in the cause of Allah when, without doubt, we have been turned out from our residences and our sons?” So when Qital was ordered for them, they turned back, except a minority among them. And Allah is fully Aware of the transgressors"
