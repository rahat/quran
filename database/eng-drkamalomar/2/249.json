    "text": "And when Talut marched forward with the military regiments, he said: “Verily, Allah is going to test you at the stream, so one who drank freely (from the water to completely quench his thirst) from it, he is not of my own (people), and one who does not drink to satisfaction from it, then certainly he is of my own (people) except one who made a cup-like shape in (the palm of) his hand (and then drank a palm-cup only). But they drank to their satisfaction from this (stream) except a minority among them. So when he crossed it, (i.e., ) he and the people who had Believed with him, they (who had failed the test) said: “Today (we find) no power in us in comparison to Jalut (Goliath) and his forces.” Those who were convinced that they are those who must meet Allah said: “How often a tiny force has overwhelmed an overflowing force with the permission of Allah, and Allah is on the side of those who are patient and perseverent.”"
