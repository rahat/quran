    "text": "Mankind is one single community: so Allah raised Prophets — those who gave good news as well as warnings; and He delivered with them Al-Kitab in original so that (The Book) may give verdict to mankind in matters wherein they had conflicting opinions. And differed not therein except those who had received this (Book) — when Al-Bayyinat had reached them. (This they did as) a mutual rebellion among themselves (against each other). So Allah gave guidance to those who Believed in what they differed therein deviating from the original. And Allah guides whom He thinks proper to Sirat-al-Mustaqim"
