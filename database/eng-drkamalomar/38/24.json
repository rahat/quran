    "text": "(Daud, without listening to the other party) said: \" Surely, indeed he has wronged you in demanding your ewe (to go) towards his ewes. And verily, many of the partners: surely oppress, some of them, some (others) â€” except those who have Believed and did righteous deeds, and very little (are those) who are they.\" And (immediately) Daud realised that what (is a fact is that) we have put him to test (and that he should have given a patient hearing to the other party before producing comments against him), so he sought forgiveness of his Nourisher-Sustainer, and as one bowing down, he fell (in prostration) and turned (to Allah in repentance)"
