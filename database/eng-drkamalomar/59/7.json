    "text": "Whatever Allah brought as Fai onto His Messenger from the residents of the habitations — so (it is) for Allah and for His Messenger, and for those in close relationship, and the orphans, and the indigents, and the wayfarer — in order that it may not remain circulating among the rich amongst you. And whatever the Messenger gave you, take it; and whatever he asked you to avoid, then abstain from it. And pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in retribution"
