You thought not that they would come out, and they (themselves) became sure that they: their fortresses are shields unto them against Allah. So Allah came to them from a place they expected not; and He cast terror in their hearts. They will destroy their houses with their (own) hands and the hands of the Believers. So take admonition, O you possessors of the eyesights"
