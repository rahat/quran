We, We have distributed their provisions among them in the life of this world; and We have elevated some of them, over some (others) in ranks, so that some of them may pick-up some (others) as employees (or subordinates). And the Mercy proceeding from your Nourisher-Sustainer is better than that which they amass (as the temporary wealth of this immediate life)"
