(See Verses 43/63, 61/6)]; and sent down alongwith them Al-Kitab and Al-Mizan (‘The Balance’) so that humans may establish (themselves) with justice. And We sent down iron; therein (is material for) violent warfare and benefits for mankind, and so that Allah may distinguish and comes to know who helps Him and His Messengers unseen. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Powerful"
