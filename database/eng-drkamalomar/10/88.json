Surely, You have bestowed Firaun and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of this world, our Nourisher-Sustainer, so that they may lead (men) astray from your Path? Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Destroy their possessions and harden their hearts, so that they may not Believe until they see the painful torment.”"
