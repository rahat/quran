    "text": "And this Al-Quran is not such as could be falsely produced from (somebody) besides Allah; rather (it is) a verification and confirmation to what is in its two hands and details to Al-Kitab [the word 'Qur'an' means some thing which is read by emitting words. When Allah's Book is subjected to Qir'at, it confirms what is available in the written copies of the scripture already available anywhere in the world, and it also contains details to all the verdicts available in the Book]. There is no doubtful matter or interpolation therein, (it is) from the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds"
