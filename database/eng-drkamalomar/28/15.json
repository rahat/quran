    "text": "And he entered the city at a time of unawareness from its residents, and he found therein two male-adults fighting among themselves — this (one) from his group, and this (one) from (the group of) his enemy. Then he who was from his group asked him for assistance against that who was from (the group of) his enemy. So Musa struck him with a fist and he (through this blunt injury) completed (his life-span) to him (i.e., the man died). (Musa) said: “This is out of Satan’s handiwork; indeed he is an enemy, a manifest misleader.”"
