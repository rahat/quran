And it does not suit us that we return to it except that Allah, our Nourisher-Sustainer desires (some other outlet). Our Nourisher-Sustainer became Fully Comprehensive in knowledge for all things. In Allah we have put our trust. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Judge between us and between our nation in justice. And You are the Best of the judges.”"
