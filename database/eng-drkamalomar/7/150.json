    "text": "And when returned Musa to his nation, angry and grieved, he said: “Evil it is what you people did in my absence, after me. Did you people make haste regarding the order of your Nourisher-Sustainer (who advised me a stay of many nights away from you)? And he put down Al-Alwah (with full respect) and he seized his brother (Harun) by the head (and) he drags him towards himself. (Facing this, Harun) said: “Son of my mother! Indeed the nation regarded me weak and they went to the stage (that) they will kill me. So do not make the enemies make a fun of me and don’t regard me as being with the nation of transgressors.”"
