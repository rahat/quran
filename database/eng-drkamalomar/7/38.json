    "text": "(Allah) said: “Enter you among (the company of the) Umam who definitely went before you — out of Jinn and mankind — in (Hell-) Fire. Every time an ummah entered (Hell-Fire) it cursed her sister (community), until when they settled therein — altogether, the latter of them said for their earlier one: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! These very ones made us astray. So provide them more severe punishment out of the Fire.” (Allah) said: “To all (of you it is) more severe but you do not know.”"
