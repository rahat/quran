    "text": "And Musa picked up his nation (in the form of) seventy (representative) male-adults for Our appointed time and place for meeting, but when a violent tremor seized them, (Musa) said: â€œMy Nourisher-Sustainer! If You had willed You could have destroyed them before and me too; would You destroy us because of what committed the foolish amongst us? It is not but a test from You. You send astray through it whom You think proper and You guide whom You think proper. You are our Wali, so grant forgiveness for us and have mercy on us, and You are the Best of those who forgive"
