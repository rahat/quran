    "text": "And We made inheritors — the nation of those who had been made weak in persecution — of the easts of the land and its wests which We had blessed therein. And the fair word of your Nourisher-Sustainer got fulfilled over Bani Israiel because they showed endurance and perseverance. And We completely destroyed what Firaun and his nation were inventing (in their space technology) and what they were directing upwards (in space)"
