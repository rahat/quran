If it happens that there come to you Messengers, from amongst you (who may be physically present amongst you, or you come across their personalities in the Text of Al-Kitab), narrating over you My Ayaat, then whosoever paid obedience (to My Ayaat) and reformed (his beliefs, concepts, actions and practices), then there is no fear for them and nor they shall grieve (in depression and anxiety)"
