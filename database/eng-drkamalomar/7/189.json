    "text": "[Note that the word Nafs means life or self. It is always referred in female gender. The word Zauj means a partner, a mate, a kind or a consort. It could be referred to as male in gender or as female. The word Zaujah is female in word-form and is regarded female in gender.] He it is Who created you from a single Nafs and He evolved out of this a Zauj to this, so that he finds pleasure and tranquility in her. So when he covered her (in sexual approach, as husband and wife), she conceived a very light pregnancy. So she continued moving with this (pregnancy). So when she became heavy, the twain invoked Allah — the Nourisher-Sustainer to these two: “Surely if You bestow us a salih (a righteous one), surely we shall be out of the grateful.”"
