    "text": "And when Musa came to the site of sitting appointed by Us and his Nourisher-Sustainer talked to him, he said: “My Rabb! Be apparent to me, I will look upon you.” Allah said: “Never shall you see Me (as your abilities as a human creation stand limited) but (continue to) look towards the mountain, then if it stood stationary and entire at its place, then soon you shall see Me.” So when his Nourisher-Sustainer manifested in Light for the mount, He made it collapsed to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he revived (in his senses and became fully conscious) he said: “Glory to You, I have turned to You in repentance and I am the First of the Believers.”"
