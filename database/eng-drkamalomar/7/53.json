The Day, comes its final outcome (i.e., the Events of Resurrection and Accountability), those who forgot it since before will say: “Indeed, the Messengers of our Nourisher-Sustainer did come with Al-Haqq, so is there for us any out of the intercessors so they might intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back (to further pass the life in the world) so that we might act (quite) differently to that which we used to do?” Verily, they lost against their selves and has gone away from them what they had been fabricating (in the name of Allah or Religion)"
