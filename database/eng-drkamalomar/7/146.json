    "text": "Soon I shall turn away from My Ayaat those who behave in arrogance on the earth without (any) right and if they noticed each and every Ayat they will not believe in them. And if they noticed the path to righteousness they will not adopt it as the Way. And if they noticed the path of rebellion they will adopt it as the way. This is because they have belied Our Ayaat and they remained unaware of them"
