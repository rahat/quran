    "text": "They put a query to you about the Hour: “When does its appointed time come?” Say: “Definitely it is that the knowledge thereof is with my Nourisher-Sustainer. None makes it manifest in accordance with its (fixed) time except He. It stood as a very extreme incident in the heavens and the earth. It shall not approach you people but all of a sudden.” They ask you as if you are well informed about it in advance. Say: “Definitely it is that its knowledge is with Allah (Alone), but most of mankind know not.”"
