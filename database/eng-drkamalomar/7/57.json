    "text": "And it is He who sends the winds as a good sign between the two hands of His Mercy (i.e., heralding the approach of His Mercy in the form of rains or improvement in weather) â€” till when they carried cloud, becoming heavy (due to excessive amount of water), We moved it to a habitation (appearing) dead (due to long absence of rains), then We delivered through it (rain-) water; then We brought forth therewith all kinds of fruits. In this (very way) We shall bring forth (i.e., revive) the dead (on the Day of Resurrection), per chance you may be reminded and may remind others"
