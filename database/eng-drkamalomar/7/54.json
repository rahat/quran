    "text": "Indeed your Nourisher-Sustainer is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six aeons, then He set (Himself) on the Throne (i.e., established His Rule). He brings the night as a covering over the day, it covers over it rapidly. And (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars completely under control, subject to His Command. Beware! The creation as well as the commandment belongs to Him. Blessed became (the Name of) Allah, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds"
