They are (those whom) shall reach their share from Al-Kitab (i.e., the punishments and recompense as explained in this Guide-Book) until when reached them Our messengers (and) they implement wafat (death) over them, (these angel-messengers) said: “Where are those whom you used to invoke besides Allah?” (The dying ones) said: “They have deserted us.” And (thus) they gave evidence against their ownselves that they were disbelievers"
