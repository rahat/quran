    "text": "O Bani Adam! Let not Satan put you to test as he took out your parents from the orchard. He removes from both of them the clothing of both of them so that he may expose over both of them the bodies of the twain. Definitely he (i.e., the Satan) keeps a watch over you — he as well as his tribe, — from where you do not see them. Verily, We have appointed (these) Satans as ‘auliya’ for those who do not Believe (in Al-Kitab)"
