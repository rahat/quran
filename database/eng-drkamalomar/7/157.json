    "text": "those who follow the Messenger, the Ummi Prophet, that one whom they find written with them in At-Taurat and Al-Injeel — he commands them for Al-Ma’ruf and he forbids against Al-Munkar, he makes lawful to them At-Tayyibat, and declares prohibited to them Al-Khabaith, and he removes from them their self-imposed burdens (like illegitimate and concocted customs and concepts) and chains and fetters (of uncalled for and self-created practices) which seized them. So those who Believed in him, and gave him honour and helped him and adopted An-Noor (‘The Light’. This is one of the attributes of Al-Kitab) which has been sent down with him — these people: they are those who attain success"
