(Sulaiman) said: “Truly, it is a palace (underneath which runs a river, simulating the delights in Paradise) paved smooth with slab of crystal-clear glass. She said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, I have wronged myself and I have accepted Islam in the presence of Sulaiman in complete devotion to Allah, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds.”"
