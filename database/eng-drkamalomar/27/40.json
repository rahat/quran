    "text": "Said that with whom was knowledge from Al-Kitab : “I will come to you with it even earlier than ' the margin of your eyelid returns to you' (i.e., within the twinkling of an eye).\" So when he saw it placed before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Nourisher-Sustainer so that He may test me whether I become grateful or I become ungrateful. And whoever pays thanks (to Allah, it is) for his own self, and whoever became ungrateful — then certainly my Nourisher-Sustainer is Free of all wants, Bountiful.”"
