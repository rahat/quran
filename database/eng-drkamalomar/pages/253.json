The command to all extent is with Allah (Alone). Have they who have Believed not realised that if Allah thinks proper He would have surely guided the entire mankind? And those who have disbelieved shall not stop (it). Qariah (disaster) shall reach them because of what they have forged or it will befall close to their home until the Promise of Allah comes (into action). Certainly, Allah does not defy the promised one"

Do you inform Him of something He knows not in the earth (since He has absolutely no partners in His Dominion, or you are befooling people) through the apparent in the statement?” Nay! Their stratagem who have disbelieved has been made fair-seeming to them and they have been hindered from the path. And whom Allah sends astray, then there is none out of a guide for him"
