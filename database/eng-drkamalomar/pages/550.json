Then if you became certain about these women (that they are) Believing females, then do not send them back to the disbelievers; those women are not lawful unto them and nor they become lawful (as husbands) for those women (who have reverted to Islam). And compensate them what these (disbelieving husbands) have spent (as bridal money on these women). And there is no blame on you that you bind in Nikah (wedlock) those women (although no divorce has been pronounced by their previous husbands) when you have paid those women their bridal-money (ujoor or Mahr). Likewise do not continue the links of wedlock of the disbelieving women. And you should demand what you spent (on such women as bridal-money); and let those (disbelieving husbands like wise) ask (as demand) what they have spent (on those women who have reverted to Islam and have deserted them). This unto you (is) Allah’s Ordainment. He makes judgment amongst you. And Allah is All-Aware, All-Wise"
