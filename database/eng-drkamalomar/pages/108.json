When you have stood up for Salat, then wash your faces and your fore-arms upto the elbows and rub (your wet hands) on to your heads (i.e., scalps) and wash your feet upto the two ankle-knuckles. And if you are in a state of Janaba then cleanse (your body with water). And if you are ill or (you are) on a journey, or one of you has come out of the toilet (after answering the call of nature), or you have made sexual contact with women and you find not water — then utilize clean-clay (to soak the emissions and clean the part); then rub your faces and your hands (upto the wrists) therewith (i.e., with additional clean dust). Allah does not intend that He may place over you out of burden, rather He intends that He may cleanse you and that He may complete His Favour on you so that you may pay thanks"
