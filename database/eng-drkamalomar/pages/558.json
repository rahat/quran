And pay obedience to Allah, Nourisher-Sustainer unto you. Do not make them go from their residence (where they are living uptil now with their husbands), and they shall not go (even on their own) — except (under punishment) that they indulge in evident lewdness. And these are the limits of Allah. And whoever overrides the limits of Allah, then surely he had committed transgression against his (own) Nafs. You (who could pronounce divorce unto wife) do not comprehend — may be Allah brings out an absolutely new situation after this (for handling) the matter (and thus make you understand the benefit and the philosophy regarding the iddat)"

And arrange for the testimony of two just persons from amongst you (Muslims). And preserve the evidence for Allah (i.e., you should give it the form of a document bearing the signatures or impressions of two witnesses). This unto you, He admonishes therewith that one who used to Believe in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever pays obedience to Allah, He will make for him a way out (for every difficult situation)"

See Verses 4/6, 24/60). And who are holders of the products of gestation — their prescribed period (for iddat is) that they deliver their pregnancy.
