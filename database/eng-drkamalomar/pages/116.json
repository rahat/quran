So pronounce judgement amongst them in accordance with what Allah has sent down, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from what has come to you out of Al-Haqq. To each, We have prescribed, among you — a (lawful) track and a (commendable) way. And if Allah had willed, surely He would have made you (under compulsion) one homogenous group. But (He did not apply compulsion) so that He may test you in what He has given you (in His Al-Kitab); so strive and race to come first in virtuous deeds. Towards Allah is your return — altogether, then He will inform you about that — you used to differ therein"
