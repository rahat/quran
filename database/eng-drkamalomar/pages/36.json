And it is not lawful for them that they may conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they happen to Believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have a better right to take them back (as wives) during this (waiting period) if they intended for reconciliation. And in the interest of those women (are rights for honourable residence and living expenses and personality-protection) similar to those imposed on these women (that they would obey their husbands, respect him and exclusively guard their own chastity) — (all) in a most desirable way. And for men, in comparison to these women, is one point (being Qawwam of the family unit, and having a right of rejoining with the wife during the waiting period). And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"

And it is not lawful to you that you may retain anything out of what you have given to these women (any time in married life) except when a (particular) pair apprehends that the pair can not honour the conditions ordained by Allah (as the requirements of a married life). Then if you feared that these two would not abide by the ordainments of Allah, then there is no sin on (either of) these two in what she (i.e., the wife) paid to him (i.e., the husband) as ransom to this (pronouncement of divorce by husband against his will, only on wife’s initiative). These are the limits set by Allah, then override them not. And one who overrides the limits set by Allah, then such are those who are transgressors"
