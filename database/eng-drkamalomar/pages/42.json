And if Allah had so willed the succeeding generations would not have fought amongst each other, after Al-Bayyinat had come to them. But they differed in interpretation. So some of them Believed and some of them rejected. And if Allah had so willed they would not have fought each other. But Allah does what He thinks proper"

Who is he that intercedes with Him except under His permission? He knows whatever is in their two hands and whatever is behind them. They shall not grasp any thing out of His knowledge except whatever He permitted. His dominion extends and covers the heavens and the earth. The maintenance of these two brings Him no fatigue. And He is the Most High, the Supreme"
