Then, when they have completed their prescribed waiting period, there is no blame on you people for what these women do in the interest of their ownselves (like arranging another marriage) in a desirable way. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do"

Allah knows, soon you would discuss (the future of) such women. But do not make any secret promise to them (for marriage) except that you say honourable word. And do not take a firm decision about the bond of marriage until the prescribed waiting period comes to an end. And do realise that definitely Allah knows what is inside yourselves, then be careful of Him. And know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing"
