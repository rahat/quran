Those people: (Allah) has engraved Faith in their hearts and He has strengthened them with a Ruh (Spirit) proceeding from Him. And He will admit them to Gardens — flow underneath them rivers, abiders therein. Allah got pleased with them and they got pleased with Him. They are Hizbullah (Group of Allah). Beware!
