And the gestation-period for him and the weaning of him (make) thirty months — until when he attained his full strength and attained forty years, he said, “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Bestow me (the power) that I may pay thanks for Your favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may perform righteous deeds that You may agree with it; and make reform in my offspring for my sake. Truly, I have turned to You, and truly I am (one) of the Muslims.”"

Develop Faith, surely the Promise of Allah is true.” Still he utters: “This (Al-Kitab) is not but written records of the initial people.”"
