They shall either fight you in an armed encounter, or they shall seek peace (with you). So if you pay obedience Allah will pay you a fair reward; and if you turned away as you have turned back on previous occasion, He will put you to punishment — of a painful torment.”"

See Verse No. 24). And (this He appreciated) so that it (i.e., the signing of a peace treaty to overcome adverse conditions and periods) becomes a Sign for the Believers; and in order that He may guide you to Siratam Mustaqim"
