And shall (now) come the other group (who has) not Prayed; so they shall (now) Pray with you (in your 2nd rak’at only), and they shall continue to hold on to their shields and armaments. Desired those who have disbelieved that you become unaware and negligent of your arms and baggage, then they make assault on you — a single (effective) assault! And (there is) no blame on you, if there is with you inconvenience because of rains or you are people under effect of illness — that (under such a state) you put aside your armaments (while you are in the act of Prayer), but hold on to your shields (of protection). Certainly, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment"

Surely the Prayer is prescribed to the Believers at specified timings"
