And if they had said: ‘we have heard and we have obeyed’ and ‘hear and unzurna — definitely it would have been better for them and more effective (in meaning): but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they have no Faith, except a minority (among them)"

Thus, they were directed to take part in the weekly Institution. Mankind needs a sermon based on Allah’s Book, followed by Salat in Congregation every week). And the commandment of Allah got fulfilled (and this led to the appearance of ‘human apes’ and ‘human pigs’ as a permanent admonition)"
