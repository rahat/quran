And if she happened to be one only, then for her is half (of the total inheritance). And for his parents (when the deceased is the son): for every one out of these two (i.e., the father and the mother, the share is) one sixth out of what he (i.e., the deceased son) left — if there is for him a child. Then if there is not to him a child and have inherited him his parents (all exclusively): then for his mother (is) one third. Then if (there is) to him a brother: then for his mother (is) one sixth. (All this distribution process shall commence) after the (fulfillment of) bequeathal he (i.e., the deceased) bequeaths about it, or (the complete payment of) any debt (which is to the credit of the deceased). Your parents and your children: you assess not who, out of them, is closer to you in benefit (therefore the formulae for dividing the inheritance are) ordained by Allah (Himself). Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
