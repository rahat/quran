And they shall not make evident their beauty except for their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their own sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their own brothers, or the sons of their own brothers, or the sons of their own sisters, or their own women (i.e., who become their sisters in Islam and are not expected to betray them), or those whom their own right hands held in trust, or such of male employees as have no sexual appetite, or young children who have not become fully aware about the sexual areas of women. And they must not strike with their legs so that it may become known what they hide out of their beauty. And turn you to Allah — altogether, you Believers, so that you may prosper"
