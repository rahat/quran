And whoever follows footsteps of the satan, then verily, he (i.e., the satan) commands Al-Fahsha (obscenity, immorality and vulgarity) and Al-Munkar (the undesirable and the prohibited). And if (there is) not the Grace of Allah over you, and His Mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure (from sins). But Allah purifies whom he thinks proper. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"

Do not enter houses other than your own houses, until you have asked and have been granted permission, and you have sent ‘salam’ (peace and blessing) unto their occupants; this is better for you in order that you may remind (yourself, and remind others). [This verse gives a start to the directions and admonitions to control and regulate the behaviour of the society. This counselling continues in many verses that follow. The wordings in this verse indicate that the incident of slander was cooked up on the basis of something which was noticed and misunderstood when a person entered in a house out of a sudden, without ashead of state permission of the inmates. Those who have not pondered over the Divine words have wrongly accepted another incident which was forged to malign the Last Prophet’s marital life]"
