And you shall not take them back to torture them or to take undue advantage. And whosoever does this — then certainly he has wronged his own self. And do not ridicule Allah’s statements. And bring to mind Allah’s grace on you and whatever He delivered to you as Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah. He guides you through it. And pay obedience to Allah and beware that verily, Allah is Aware of every thing"

This, He propounds with for the one amongst you who Believes in Allah and the Last Day. This to you is more pious to you and more sanctified. And Allah knows and you do not know"

And one, to whom the delivered one belongs, is himself responsible for the food and dress expenditure for such women on desirable terms. No soul shall be burdened except to its capacity. Mother shall not be subjected to unfair treatment on account of her child; nor he whom the child belongs on account of his child. And on the heir lies the same responsibility. And if they two decide on weaning by mutual consent and consultation, there is no blame on these two. And if you intended that you provide a foster-mother to your child, then there is no blame on you when you paid in full (as initially agreed upon) whatever you paid in a desirable way. And pay obedience to Allah and beware that verily, Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
