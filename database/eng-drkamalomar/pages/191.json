So they must not approach Al-Masjid-al-Haram after this year (i.e., this lunar year which is having this Hajj congregation in its closing month; and the year comes to a close three weeks after the Greater Day of Al-Hajj. Also see Ayaat 1st to 5th of this Surah to understand the end of the Al-Ashhurul-Hurum or the Protected Months). And if you apprehended decrease in revenue, then very soon Allah will make you rich out of His bounty if He thought proper. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
