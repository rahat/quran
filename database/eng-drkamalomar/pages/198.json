So they enjoyed with their portion, then you enjoyed with your portion in the same way as enjoyed those who went before you with their portion; and you indulged in purposeless activity as they indulged in purposeless activity. Those people: their deeds went in vain in this world and in the Hereafter. And those people: they (very ones are) the losers"
