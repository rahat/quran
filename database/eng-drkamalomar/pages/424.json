Verily, We made lawful to you your consorts to whom you have delivered their ujoor; and that whom your right (hands) held in trust — out of those whom Allah has gifted to you; and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts — who have migrated with you; and a Believing woman if she offered her self for (the mission of) the Prophet — provided the Prophet intended that he may take her in wedlock. This is a permission exclusively for you (Prophet), excluding the rest of the Believers. Indeed, We knew what We have enjoined upon them about their consorts, and what their right (hands) held in trust. (The permission and restriction applicable to the Prophet) is given in order that there remains no difficulty for you (in boosting your mission of propagation). And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
