(And bring to mind) when people dispute amongst them their case, so they said: “Build as a mark of respect to them a monument.\" Their Nourisher-Sustainer knows more about them. Those who prevailed regarding their case said: “(As We are Believing Muslims) we must build a Mosque in their honour.”"

And (yet others) will say: “(They were) seven and the eighth of them (being) their dog.” Say: “My Nourisher-Sustainer knows better about their number. People do not know them, except a small minority.” So discuss them not except a limited view, and do not seek information concerning them from any one of those (who confront you)"
