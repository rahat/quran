See the word Masfooh in Verse 6/145), and flesh of the swine, and that which has been pronounced for other than Allah, along with Him, and the one killed by strangulation, and one killed by violent blow or hit, and one killed by a head-long fall, and one killed by the goring of horns, and that which a wild animal has eaten — except that which you cleansed (by providing an exit to the free blood through a cut on the carotid arteries at the neck), and that which is sacrificed at the places and sites dedicated to other than Allah (like an altar of a god); and it is also forbidden to you that you may make divisions, (shares, portions and rights) on the basis of lottery or raffle — (all) this to you is Fisqun. This day, have given up all hope (for inter-Faith mixing and befriending) those who have disbelieved (in Allah’s Book) — vis a vis your Religion. So fear them not, but pay regard to Me. This day (when one completes a serial study of the Divine Book from 1/1 to 5/3) I have completed for you (a general discussion of) Your Religion and I have finalised upon you people My Grace and have agreed with you for Islam as (your) Religion. Then whoever went restless due to hunger, without (being) inclined to sin, then surely, Allah (is) Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful (for such exceptional cases if they broke the law of these prohibitions)"

            "text": "They would ask you what is that which has been made lawful for them (as food). Say: “At-Tayyibat are made lawful to you; as well as which you taught Al-Jawareh; (acting as)Mokallebin. You teach them (i.e., to your Al-Jawareh, including dogs and hounds as well as the birds of prey called falcons) out of what Allah has made known to you (that the hunting animal should only seize the prey, shall not eat or consume it and shall not harbour the desire to devour it directly). So eat out of what they have seized and brought for you, and do pronounce the name of Allah over it (while you give a cut at the carotid arteries of the neck to provide an easy exit to the free blood available in the body of the prey); and pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is swift in accountability"

And Al-Muhsanat (the chaste women with known family background) from amongst Al-Mominat, and Al-Muhsanat from amongst Al-Lazina-ootul-Kitab (the people who were given Al-Kitab) before you (are made lawful to you, for marriage as wives) when you have paid them their Ujoor (thus proving yourself as) Muhseneen (desirous of maintaining a permanent family link), not being Musafeheen, and not being that who picks up temporary friends and companions. And whoever rejects or will reject Faith (in the Teachings in Al-Kitab) then definitely he has destroyed his act (of starting a family-life in marriage) and he, in the Hereafter, will be from amongst the losers"
