The skins of those who are conscious and mindful of the position of their Nourisher-Sustainer, shiver from it (when they feel the force and impact of the Message). Then their skins and their hearts soften towards Zikr (Message) of Allah. This is Hudah (guidance) from Allah. He guides therewith whom He thinks proper. And whomsoever Allah lets go astray — then (there is) not for him out of (any) guide. [Please note that this Verse contains, in all, four attributes for Al-Kitab. Two of these are single worded like Zikr and Hudah. One is three worded, while Ahsan-al-Hadees is two worded attribute for the Book of Allah. Allah recognises only His Book as the collection of Authentic Ahadees]"
