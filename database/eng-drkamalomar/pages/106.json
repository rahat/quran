Say: “Allah gives you religious-legal opinion about Al-Kalalah (see 12th Verse of this Surah for the definition of the term): if a man who died — (there is) not to him a child, but (there is) to him a sister, then for her is half of what he (as brother) left. And he (as brother) inherits her (full, if the deceased is his sister) provided there does not exist for her a child. Then if there happened to be two females (as sisters to a deceased brother), then for (these) two females (is) two thirds out of what he left (as brother to them). And if they happened to be brethren — men and women (mixed) — then for a male (goes an amount) equal to the share of two females. Allah explains for you, otherwise you go astray. And Allah is All-Knower about every thing.”"

Grazing quadrupeds (the four footed animals who eat grass) are declared lawful to you (for food) except what is recited to you (herein) without being those who permit game while you (people) are under prohibition (due to being within the area called Harem, or you are putting on the uniform dress called Ehram). Verily, Allah commands what He wills"

Violate not the sanctity of Sha’irullah [Signs and symbols (of obedience to) Allah] that is, neither of the Protected Month, and nor of Al-Hadiya (Animal proceeding to the Kaba for sacrifice); and neither the necklaces or collars (that such animals are putting on), and nor of those who are proceeding to the Sacred, Protected and Prohibited House — they seek the Bounty proceeding from their Nourisher-Sustainer and (His) agreement and pleasure. And when you have become free of prohibitions (i.e., you put off Ehram and you are outside the limits of Harem-area, only) then you indulge in game of hunting. And shall not lead you the hatred (exhibited) by a nation that they obstructed you from reaching, The Sacred, Protected and Prohibited Mosque — that you indulge in hostility or transgression (on your part). Assist one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa, and do not help one another in sin and transgression. And pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in giving punishment"
