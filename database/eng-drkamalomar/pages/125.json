Detain both of them after As-Salat, then both shall swear by Allah — if you doubted — (saying): “We shall not barter this (testimony) for a sum even though he (i.e., the beneficiary) be our near relative. And we shall not hide testimony of Allah, certainly we in that position, surely (become) out of the sinful ones.”"

Then these (latter) two shall swear by Allah (saying): “Surely our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not trespassed (the truth), for indeed we, then, surely (become) out of the wrong-doers.”"
