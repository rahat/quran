But whosoever does not find (himself in a position to pay such an expiation) then (he shall keep) fasts for three days. This is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn. But it shall be better if you protect your oaths (provided they are not undesirable). Thus Allah explains to you His Ayaat so that you may be grateful"
