And the invocation of the disbelievers is not but in complete deviation (from the fruitful path)"

Or whether the darknesses and the light become equal?” Or whether they have assigned to Allah partners who created the like of His creation; then the creation (of these two sources, i.e., Allah and their imaginary deities) brought confusion of similarity over them? Say: “Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the One, the Irresistible.”"

Thus Allah illustrates the truth and the falsehood. Then as to the useless foam, it disappears out as scum (along the banks), while as to that which benefits mankind, it settles down on the earth. Thus Allah sets forth parables"
