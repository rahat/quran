And He will surely give them in exchange safety after their (state of) fear — they will pay obedience to Me (Alone), will not associate as partners to Me anything.

Must take permission from you those whom your right hands held in trust, and those who have not reached the age of puberty amongst you on three occasions: before Salat-ul-Fajr (dawn-prayer), and while you put off your extra-clothings due to extreme heat (of the midday sun), and after Salat-ul-Isha (dark-night prayer). (These) three (times) are of privacy for you. (There is) not on you and nor on them (any) blame barring those (three times if they are) those who move about you — some of you to some (others). Thus Allah explains for you Ayaat. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
