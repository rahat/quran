If you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then (consider that) We have indeed created you people from dust, afterwards from a Nutfah, then from the hanging-mass, then from a lump of flesh — formed and (some) unformed, in order that We make (Our Power) manifest to you. And We settle in the wombs what We think proper for an appointed term, then We deliver you out as an infant. Then We (rear you) that you may attain your (age of) full strength. And among you then is he who is allowed to complete (the normal life-span), and among you is that who is driven to the worst part of life with the result that he does not know anything after (having had) knowledge. And you see the earth barren, so when We sent down unto it the (rain-) water, it stirred, and swelled and brought forth all kinds of beauteous vegetation"
