Then if you are prevented from completing it, then there is an Offering (Hadiya) as you could afford; and do not shave your scalps until the Offering (animal sacrifice) reaches the place (of sacrifice) specified for it. Then whoever amongst you falls sick or there is an injury to him somewhere in his scalp (necessitating shaving), then (he will pay) Fidyah in the form of Siyam (Fasts), or Sadaqa (payment to the needy) or Nusuk (Offering in the form of animal sacrifice). Then when you find peace and one (of you) performed Umra in combination to Hajj, then (such a one shall pay ransom) in the form of Hady (animal sacrifice) as one could easily afford. But if one did not find, then Siyam (Fasts), three days during the Hajj and seven when you have returned. These are ten, complete. This (performance of pre-Hajj Umra in Hajj-Season) is permissible for that — did not become his household — residents in (the precincts i.e., the Harem around) Al-Masjid-al-Haram. And pay obedience to Allah and know that Allah is strict in retribution"
