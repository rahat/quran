You see them bowing, and falling down in prostration (while in Prayer). They seek the Bounty from Allah and (His) Assents and Agreements. Their marks (are evident) in their facies from the effect of the submissions. This (becomes) their example in At-Taurat, and (another) example for them in Al-Injeel: like a (sown) seed which sent out its shoot, then made it firm, then it became thick, then it stood (straight and stable) on its stem. (Now) it puts the sower to wonder — that He may enrage the disbelievers because of these (happy sowers). Allah has promised those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds amongst them — forgiveness and a mighty reward"
