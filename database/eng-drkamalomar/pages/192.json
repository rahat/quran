Surely, a great number among the scholars (of religious matters) and (those posing as God-) fearing people definitely eat up the possessions of the people in an undesirable way and they obstruct people from the Way of Allah. And those who accumulate treasures of gold and silver and do not spend them in the Cause of Allah: so announce to them the tidings of a painful torment"

See Verse number 28 of this Surah, and also Verses 1st to 5th). This is the Established Religion (and it creates an atmosphere of peace and tranquility throughout the world during the month of Fasting and the three-months’ season of Hajj). So wrong not therein your ownselves (by initiating armed encounters). And do indulge in Qital with Mushrikun collectively as they make Qital with you collectively (if and when they pay no regard to the ‘protected’ status of the closing four months). And be aware that Allah is with those who are righteous"
