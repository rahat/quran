And (another) group: their selves made them anxious — they imagine about Allah, other than reality, (i.e., ) an imagination based on ignorance. They say: “Is there for us, in the affair, any say?” Tell (them): “Indeed, the affair — the whole of it belongs to Allah.” They hide within themselves what they do not reveal to you. They say: “Had there been for us a say in the affair, we would not have been killed here.” Tell them: “If you had remained in your homes, surely would have proceeded those, on whom ‘the kill’ (at the hands of the enemy) is decreed, to their beds (of death). And so that Allah makes assessment of what is in your chests, and so that He purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Aware about the condition of (the contents of) the chests"

Be not like those who have disbelieved and said about their brethren when they travelled through the earth, or were those who fight (in Allah’s Way): “If they had been with us, they would not have died and would not have been killed,” so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts.
