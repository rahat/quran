Likewise do not continue the links of wedlock of the disbelieving women. And you should demand what you spent (on such women as bridal-money); and let those (disbelieving husbands like wise) ask (as demand) what they have spent (on those women who have reverted to Islam and have deserted them).

Allah’s Book is permanent and immune to change. It has made itself evident to each and every Prophet of God. It is being propagated to mankind since Day-one and continues to be propagated till the Last Day. This very Book shall examine all mankind individually on the Day of Accountability. Note that the word Taurat has been used as an attribute for Al-Kitab which Prophet Iesa holds in his hand and is propagating to his people. Also note that the word Taurat, although present at 18 places in Allah’s Book, has nowhere been used as an attribute for Al-Kitab in relation to Prophet Musa!
