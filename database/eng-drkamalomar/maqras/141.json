And if (there is) not the Grace of Allah over you, and His Mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure (from sins). But Allah purifies whom he thinks proper. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"

The wordings in this verse indicate that the incident of slander was cooked up on the basis of something which was noticed and misunderstood when a person entered in a house out of a sudden, without ashead of state permission of the inmates. Those who have not pondered over the Divine words have wrongly accepted another incident which was forged to malign the Last Prophet’s marital life]"
