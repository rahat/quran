And he (as brother) inherits her (full, if the deceased is his sister) provided there does not exist for her a child. Then if there happened to be two females (as sisters to a deceased brother), then for (these) two females (is) two thirds out of what he left (as brother to them). And if they happened to be brethren — men and women (mixed) — then for a male (goes an amount) equal to the share of two females. Allah explains for you, otherwise you go astray. And Allah is All-Knower about every thing.”"
