And let him dictate on whom comes the liability (to pay back) and he must be obedient to Allah, his Nourisher-Sustainer. And he must not hide any thing from that (which he has to pay back). And if the one who has the liability (to repay is) mentally deficient or weak or if he has no capacity to dictate himself, then his heir or guardian would dictate faithfully in justice. And get two witnesses out of your men. And if two men are not available, then one man and two women out of those on whom you agree as witnesses. If one of those two females errs or forgets, then the 2nd of these women would remind her. And the witnesses shall not avoid or refuse when they are called (for evidence). And do not avoid for reducing it into writing, whether small in amount or large in sum, for the period fixed. This action of yours is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as a piece of evidence and nearer in mahead of state you immune to falling in disputes or doubts — except if it is a ready trade which you finalise among yourselves on the spot. Then it is no blame on you if you do not write it down. And do have witness whenever you make commercial contract. And neither the scribe nor the witness be put to any harm. And if you committed (this), then it would be a wickedness on your part. And pay obedience to Allah. And Allah teaches you knowledge. And Allah is All-Aware with each and every thing"
