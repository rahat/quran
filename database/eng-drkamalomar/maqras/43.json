Verily, Allah commands what He wills"

Violate not the sanctity of Sha’irullah [Signs and symbols (of obedience to) Allah] that is, neither of the Protected Month, and nor of Al-Hadiya (Animal proceeding to the Kaba for sacrifice); and neither the necklaces or collars (that such animals are putting on), and nor of those who are proceeding to the Sacred, Protected and Prohibited House — they seek the Bounty proceeding from their Nourisher-Sustainer and (His) agreement and pleasure. And when you have become free of prohibitions (i.e., you put off Ehram and you are outside the limits of Harem-area, only) then you indulge in game of hunting. And shall not lead you the hatred (exhibited) by a nation that they obstructed you from reaching, The Sacred, Protected and Prohibited Mosque — that you indulge in hostility or transgression (on your part). Assist one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa, and do not help one another in sin and transgression. And pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in giving punishment"

This day, have given up all hope (for inter-Faith mixing and befriending) those who have disbelieved (in Allah’s Book) — vis a vis your Religion. So fear them not, but pay regard to Me. This day (when one completes a serial study of the Divine Book from 1/1 to 5/3) I have completed for you (a general discussion of) Your Religion and I have finalised upon you people My Grace and have agreed with you for Islam as (your) Religion. Then whoever went restless due to hunger, without (being) inclined to sin, then surely, Allah (is) Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful (for such exceptional cases if they broke the law of these prohibitions)"

You teach them (i.e., to your Al-Jawareh, including dogs and hounds as well as the birds of prey called falcons) out of what Allah has made known to you (that the hunting animal should only seize the prey, shall not eat or consume it and shall not harbour the desire to devour it directly). So eat out of what they have seized and brought for you, and do pronounce the name of Allah over it (while you give a cut at the carotid arteries of the neck to provide an easy exit to the free blood available in the body of the prey); and pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is swift in accountability"
