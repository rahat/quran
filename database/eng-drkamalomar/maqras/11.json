Then complete the fasts till it is night (and the sun is no more visible). And do not have sexual relations with them while you are in Itikaf in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so don’t stand at its edge. Thus Allah explains His statements for mankind so that they may become Al-Muttaqun"
