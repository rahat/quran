    "text": "Is then That One (just a partner in controlling the dominion of the universe?) He is Surveillant over all persons about what they did. And they have assigned partners to Allah. Say: “Allot them their titles (or attributes in accordance to their functions.) Do you inform Him of something He knows not in the earth (since He has absolutely no partners in His Dominion, or you are befooling people) through the apparent in the statement?” Nay! Their stratagem who have disbelieved has been made fair-seeming to them and they have been hindered from the path. And whom Allah sends astray, then there is none out of a guide for him"
