The command to all extent is with Allah (Alone). Have they who have Believed not realised that if Allah thinks proper He would have surely guided the entire mankind? And those who have disbelieved shall not stop (it). Qariah (disaster) shall reach them because of what they have forged or it will befall close to their home until the Promise of Allah comes (into action). Certainly, Allah does not defy the promised one"
