    "text": "Say: \"Who is the Nourisher-Sustainer for the heavens and the earth? ” Say “(It is) Allah.” Say: “Have you then picked up ‘auliya’ other than Him, (such as) do not possess for themselves (any) benefit and nor (any) harm?” Say: “Do the blind and the one who can see fully become equal? Or whether the darknesses and the light become equal?” Or whether they have assigned to Allah partners who created the like of His creation; then the creation (of these two sources, i.e., Allah and their imaginary deities) brought confusion of similarity over them? Say: “Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the One, the Irresistible.”"
