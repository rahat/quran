And those whom they invoke besides Him, they respond them not in any form except like one who stretches forth his two palms in the direction of the water so that it (itself) may reach his mouth although it will not be one that reaches it. And the invocation of the disbelievers is not but in complete deviation (from the fruitful path)"
