    "text": "For him, there are (angel-) escorts inbetween his two hands (i.e., exactly on his front, just like a body-shield) and on his back. They guard him under command of Allah. Verily, Allah does not substitute whatever is in possession of a nation until they (themselves) substitute whatever is in possession of their selves. And when Allah intended about a nation (to inflict them with) evil, then there is not a way of return for this (punishment), and there is not for them, besides Him, out of a Protector"
