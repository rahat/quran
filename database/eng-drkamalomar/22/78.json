He has chosen you and has not laid upon you regarding Religion any hardship, sanctioning for you the Millat of your father, Ibrahim. He (i.e., Allah) has named you Muslims before and in this (era) â€” so that the Messenger may become a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind. So establish Salat and pay-off Zakat and hold firmly to Allah. He is your Maula. What an excellent Maula and what an excellent Naseer"
