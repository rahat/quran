    "text": "And say: “(It is) Al-Haqq from your Nourisher-Sustainer”. Then whosoever desired, let him Believe; and whosoever desired, let him disbelieve. Verily, We have prepared for the transgressors a Fire — whose (flaming) limits have enclosed them. And if they will cry for water (out of thirst) they will be supplied with water (as hot) as molten lead which will burn the faces — an evil drink and it became dreadful as a presistent atmosphere"
