    "text": "(Instead of tahead of state inspiration from the Message in this extra-ordinary incident, the people seek the unnecessary historical details which Allah has avoided to mention). Soon they will say: “(These were) three, the fourth of them being their dog;” and they will say: “(They were) five, the sixth of them (being) their dog;” — (it is totally) a guess-work at the unseen. And (yet others) will say: “(They were) seven and the eighth of them (being) their dog.” Say: “My Nourisher-Sustainer knows better about their number. People do not know them, except a small minority.” So discuss them not except a limited view, and do not seek information concerning them from any one of those (who confront you)"
