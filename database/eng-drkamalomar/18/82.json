    "text": "And as for the wall, so it belongs to two orphan boys in Al-Madinah (The Town), and there is, under it a treasure for those two and their father had been a righteous man. So your Nourisher-Sustainer intended that the two should attain the age of full strength applicable to the two and both (together) take out the treasure of the two. (This is) a mercy from your Nourisher-Sustainer and I have not done it of my own accord. That is the interpretation (or background), of that over which you could not hold patience.\" [Thus came to an end the training-period wherein Musa stayed with a Muslim ruler to learn and grasp the worhead of state of the state]"
