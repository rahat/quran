One thing which is common to both the incidents is the descent of angel-Jibriel. The ascent of the person who is receiving the Inspiration is mentioned nowhere. It appears that some life-generating Rays or Light was showered by Allah on a garden that appeared extinct. The Life-giving source revived the garden in original state to make the recipient of Inspiration witness some of the Great Signs out of the Miraculous Signs of Allah]"
