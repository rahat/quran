    "text": "Soon you find others who desire that they may have peace and security from you as well as they may get peace and security from their own nation. Every (time) to what test (and temptation) they were sent back, they became caught in it. So if they have not avoided you, and have not sent you (a message or offer of) peace and have not restrained their hands â€” then catch them and slay them wherever you found them. And (for) those people: We have sanctioned for you, against them, a clear warrant (to initiate Qital and annihilate them in battle)"
