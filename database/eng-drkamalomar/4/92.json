    "text": "And it is not for a Believer that he kills a Believer except by mistake. And whoso killed a Believer by mistake, then providing freedom to one (human) neck (who is) a Believer, and Diyah (Murder-money) put at the disposal of his (i.e., the deceased’s) family (are ordained by Allah in compensation and ransom) except that they (i.e., the members of the deceased’s family) remit it. But if he (i.e., the deceased) is from a nation (which is) an enemy to you, and he (i.e., the deceased is) a Believer, then providing freedom to one (human) neck (who is under bond of slavery but is) a Believer (shall suffice — since sending the murder-money to the enemy territory may not be possible in every case). And if he (i.e., the deceased) is from a nation — between you and between them is a treaty, then Diyah put at the disposal of his (i.e., the deceased’s) family (is ordained), and the providing of freedom to one neck (who is) a Believer (is also applicable); so one who does not find (these things possible to act upon) then (the form of ransom or replacement is) fasts for two months, both coming one after another (seehead of state) repentance from Allah. And Allah is All-Aware, All-Wise"
