And with parents (behave with) kindness as well as with close relations, and Al-Yatama, and the needy, and the close and permanent neighbour and the occasional neighbour, and the companion by your side (e.g. during some trips, travel or movement, or your colleague), and a traveller in need and those whom your right hands held in trust.
