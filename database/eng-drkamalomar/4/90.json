    "text": "except those who reach (and join) a nation — between you and between them (there is) a treaty (of peace, and non-interference); or they came to you: their breasts constricted and restrained — that they (may ever) fight you or fight against their own nation. And if Allah had desired He would have imposed them over you, so surely they would have fought against you. So if they avoided you then they fought against you not and they did send to you (an offer of) peace — then Allah has not opened to you against them a ground (for aggression)"
