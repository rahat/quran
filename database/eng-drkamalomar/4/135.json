Become those who take a firm stand based on justice, (as) witnesses to Allah, even though (it be) against your own selves, or (against your) parents and (against your) nearest relatives â€” whether he happens to be a rich person or a poor person, so Allah is Above these two (categories and groups). So follow not the abberrant desire that you may not do justice; and if you derelict or avoid - then certainly, Allah is well-aware whatever you do"
