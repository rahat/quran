    "text": "O Ahl-ul-Kitab! Do not exceed the limits in your way of life; and do not comment about Allah except (what is) The Truth. Without doubt Al-Maseeh, Iesa, Ibn-e-Maryam is Rasulullah (Messenger of Allah) and His Kalimah, which He bestowed on Maryam and a Ruh (Spirit) proceeding from Him. So Believe in Allah and His Messengers and utter not:' Trinity (‘three’)!' Desist (from such utterances, concepts and beliefs; that would be) better for you. Certainly, what is a fact is that Allah is a single deity. He stands absolved and exalted that there happens for Him a son. To Him belongs whatever (is) in the heavens and whatever (is) in the earth. And Allah sufficed as an Advocate (to the Believers)"
