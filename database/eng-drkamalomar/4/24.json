    "text": "And Al-Muhsanat out of the women [those protected in (marriage) bond] (are also forbidden to be taken in wedlock) except those whom your right hands held in trust — a written covenant from Allah to you. And has been made lawful to you whatever is to you outside this (class) — that you may seek (them in marriage) with your wealth (and possessions) harbouring intention to remain in bond without (being those) who have fluid, temporary or shifting intentions. So what you enjoyed and benefited by this (bond of marriage) through those women (as your wives), then deliver to them their rewards made compulsory (by Allah). And (there is) no blame on you in which you became mutually agreed upon regarding it after (it becomes) a must and compulsory. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
