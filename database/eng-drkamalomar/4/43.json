    "text": "O you people who have Believed! Approach not salat when you are drunk until you are aware of what you will utter (in recitations during the act of Prayer), and nor in a state of impurity (due to emission of sexual fluid) — except (when you are a) passerby (on the) road (because there you may not be able to have a bath and change spoilt clothes) — until you arrange a wash. And if you are people down with disease or on a journey, or one of you has come out of the toilet or you have made sexual contact with women and you find not water — then you people utilize clean clay (to soak the emissions and clean the part); then rub (with some additional clean dust) your faces and your hands (upto the wrists). Surely, Allah is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving. [ See Note alongside]"
