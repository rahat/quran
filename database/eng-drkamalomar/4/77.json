    "text": "Have you not seen towards those who were told: ‘Hold back your hands (and do not start military expeditions at this stage) and establish Salat and pay up Zakat.‘ So when Qital was ordained for them, behold! A section of them fear men as (should be) the fear regarding Allah or (even) a greater fear. And they said: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Why have you ordained upon us Al-Qital? Why didn’t you grant us respite (at least) for a short while?” Tell (Them): “The Benefit and enjoyment from this world is insignificant while the Hereafter is better for that who obeyed (Allah). And you shall not be subjected to injustice even to the extent of a Fatila (a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone)"
