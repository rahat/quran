    "text": "(they are) such people who wait and watch about you. If (there) happened for you a victory from Allah, they said: “Were we not with you?” And if (there) happened for the disbelievers a share (in victory), they said: “Were we not getting advantage over you and were we not shielding you against the Believers?” So Allah will give decision about you (all) on the Day of Resurrection. And certainly Allah will not sanction the disbelievers a way (of triumph or victory) over the Believers"
