    "text": "And keep Al-Yatama under observation until when they have reached (the age of) marriage, then if you realised in them sound judgement, hand over to them their possessions; and consume it not wastefully and hastily that they might grow up (and overpower you). And whoever (among the guardians) is rich, then he shall refrain (from spending on himself) and whoever is poor, then he may utilize in a desirable way. Then, when you have delivered to them their possessions then you should arrange witness over them (who may attest that the possessions have been delivered and returned to the original owner). And Allah is All-Sufficient (as) a Reckoner"
