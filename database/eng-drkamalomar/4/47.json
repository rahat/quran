    "text": "O you people who were given Al-Kitab! Develop Faith in accordance with what We have revealed (as The Book rebrought in original) confirming that (already available) with you people, before We disfigure the faces, then We (also) turn them to their hindwards or curse them as We cursed the ‘people of As-Sabt’ (who did not adhere to temporary close-down of business and traffic. Thus, they were directed to take part in the weekly Institution. Mankind needs a sermon based on Allah’s Book, followed by Salat in Congregation every week). And the commandment of Allah got fulfilled (and this led to the appearance of ‘human apes’ and ‘human pigs’ as a permanent admonition)"
