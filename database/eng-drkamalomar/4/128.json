    "text": "And if a woman (in wedlock) apprehended from her husband, an attitude leading to break-up or separation, then there is no blame on this twain if (these) two decide some terms of reconciliation between their two-selves. And an agreement of reconciliation is better. And human inner-selves are made to sway towards selfishness (as a trait) and if you do Ehsan and pay obedience (to The Book ), then surely Allah happened to be All-Aware of what you do"
