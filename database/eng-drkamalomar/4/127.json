    "text": "And people ask instruction and verdict from you about An-Nisa (i.e., the word used in the third Verse of this very Surah, since it limits or specifies the circle wherein one can select marital partner when one desires to have more than one wife at a time). Say \"Allah gives instruction and verdict to you about An-Nisa. And what is rehearsed or recited to you in Al-Kitab (in Surah An-Nisa, Verse No. 3) â€” is about Yatamannisa (weaker class among women)) whom you give not (i.e., you approach them not for monogamy) whatever is written to them (i.e., they have a right to be accepted in marriage even when one desires to have one wife at a time), while (under guidance of your inherent nature and conscience) you do desire that you should take those women in marriage (and thus provide them family life and a home of theirs to live). And (what is rehearsed or recited to you in Al-Kitab in Surah An-Nisa, Verse No. 3, is in the interest of those) who are weakened and unprotected out of the children (born to these women, through their previous husbands who widowed or divorced these mothers). And (this instruction or verdict, coming from Allah desires) that you take a stand in favour of Al-Yatama (the weaker class of women, and more specially when they have with them children from their previous husbands). And whatever you do in the form of a good, desirable and commendable (act), then surely, Allah is All-Aware of it"
