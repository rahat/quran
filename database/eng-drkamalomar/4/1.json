    "text": "O you human beings! Be obedient to your Nourisher-Sustainer Who created you from unitary living mass (Nafsin wahidah) and created from this (remaining portion of Nafsin wahidah) a mate to this (who is fashioned in existence first) and He spread from these two, numerous men as well as women. And be mindful of Allah, That One, through Whom you appeal to one another (seehead of state bonds of marriage and rights of procreation etc.) and (also be mindful) of the wombs (that bore you). Surely, Allah is Ever-Watchful over you"
