    "text": "Forbidden to you (for marriage) are your mothers (who bore you) and your own daughters and your own sisters and your father’s sisters and your mother’s sisters, and (your) brother’s daughters and (your) sister’s daughters, and mothers to you who breast-fed you and sisters to you for sharing the breast-feeding, and mothers of your wives, and your daughter-wards in your houses and surveillance born to your wives (from some of their previous husband) to whom you have gone in (on the marital bed) — but if you have not gone in to these (mothers in marital relations) then there is no blame on you (if you take such a ward in wedlock when her mother, just after the Nikah, dies, becomes untraceable, or she takes divorce before consummation of marriage) and the wives of your sons who proceed out of your loins. And (it is also forbidden) that you create union between two sisters (by simultaneously tahead of state them in wedlock) except (i.e., leaving as it is) what has already occurred; verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
