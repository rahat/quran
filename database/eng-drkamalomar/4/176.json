    "text": "People ask you for a (religious-legal) opinion. Say: “Allah gives you religious-legal opinion about Al-Kalalah (see 12th Verse of this Surah for the definition of the term): if a man who died — (there is) not to him a child, but (there is) to him a sister, then for her is half of what he (as brother) left. And he (as brother) inherits her (full, if the deceased is his sister) provided there does not exist for her a child. Then if there happened to be two females (as sisters to a deceased brother), then for (these) two females (is) two thirds out of what he left (as brother to them). And if they happened to be brethren — men and women (mixed) — then for a male (goes an amount) equal to the share of two females. Allah explains for you, otherwise you go astray. And Allah is All-Knower about every thing.”"
