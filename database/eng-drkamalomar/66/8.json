    "text": "O you who have Believed! Turn to Allah in sincere, reforming repentance. It may be that your Nourisher-Sustainer may write off from you your sins, and admit you to Gardens, flow underneath them rivers — the Day Allah will not disgrace An-Nabi and those who Believed alongwith him. Their Light will move between their hands (i.e., in front of them) and alongwith their sides. They will say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Complete for us our Light and grant forgiveness for us. Surely, You are All-Capable over every thing .”"
