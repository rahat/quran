    "text": "And when An-Nabi confided in secrecy unto some one of his wives a matter, so when she divulged it (to another) and Allah made him aware over this (divulgence), he made known a part thereof and avoided from a portion (thereof). So when (the Prophet) transferred the news to her thereof (i.e., he made known her irresponsible act of divulgence) she said: “Who has given you this information?” (The Prophet) said: “The All-Knower and the All-Aware has transferred me information.”"
