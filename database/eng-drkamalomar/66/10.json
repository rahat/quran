    "text": "Allah brought forth an example for those who have disbelieved: the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lout. They remained under two righteous human subjects out of Our human subjects (at large), but the ladies betrayed those two. So the two did not benefit those two ladies against Allah in any away, and it was said: “Enter you both the Fire alongwith those who enter (therein).”"
