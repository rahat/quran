    "text": "O Yahya! Hold Al-Kitab with firmness. And We bestowed him decisive power while yet a child. [Note that Allah addresses Yahya directly by name. This style is again available in Verse 38/26 when Allah directly addresses Daud. No other Prophet is directly addressed in Al-Kitab by name. The permanent and eternal Manual for mankind, revealed in original to each and every Prophet of Allah has many characteristics specific to itself, not applicable to any other book or literature whatsoever]"
