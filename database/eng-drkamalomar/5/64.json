    "text": "And Al-Yahood said: “Allah’s hand is tied up (i.e., He does not fully bestow the requirements to His creation).” (Actually) their (own) hands have been tied up (and they do not spend on the needy) and they stand cursed because of what they uttered. Nay, His two hands are both widely outstretched. He spends (out of His bounty) as He thinks proper. And verily, increases most of them, whatever has been sent to you from your Nourisher-Sustainer, in obstinate rebellion and disbelief. And We have put amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Everytime they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it. And they strive on the earth for mischief and lawlessness. And Allah does not like the Mufsidun"
