Verily, has come to you, Our Messenger, he explains and clarifies for you, after a cessation of the coming of the Messengers, lest you say: ’There did not come unto us from a bearer of good news and nor a warner.’ So surely, has come to you the bearer of good news and a warner. And Allah is All-Capable over every thing"
