    "text": "(The items) made forbidden to you (for oral intake, are): the dead, and the blood (which when allowed an exit leaves the organs and tissues and flows out. See the word Masfooh in Verse 6/145), and flesh of the swine, and that which has been pronounced for other than Allah, along with Him, and the one killed by strangulation, and one killed by violent blow or hit, and one killed by a head-long fall, and one killed by the goring of horns, and that which a wild animal has eaten — except that which you cleansed (by providing an exit to the free blood through a cut on the carotid arteries at the neck), and that which is sacrificed at the places and sites dedicated to other than Allah (like an altar of a god); and it is also forbidden to you that you may make divisions, (shares, portions and rights) on the basis of lottery or raffle — (all) this to you is Fisqun. This day, have given up all hope (for inter-Faith mixing and befriending) those who have disbelieved (in Allah’s Book) — vis a vis your Religion. So fear them not, but pay regard to Me. This day (when one completes a serial study of the Divine Book from 1/1 to 5/3) I have completed for you (a general discussion of) Your Religion and I have finalised upon you people My Grace and have agreed with you for Islam as (your) Religion. Then whoever went restless due to hunger, without (being) inclined to sin, then surely, Allah (is) Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful (for such exceptional cases if they broke the law of these prohibitions)"
