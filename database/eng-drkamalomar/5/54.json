    "text": "O you who have Believed! Whoever turned back amongst you from his Religion, then very soon Allah will bring (to view) a nation; He will love them and they will love Him, humble towards the Believers, stern towards the disbelievers, striving in the Way of Allah, and they shall not be afraid of the ill-speahead of state of the censurer. This is the Grace of Allah which He bestows upon whom He wills. And Allah is All-Pervasive, All-Knowing"
