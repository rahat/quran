And Al-Muhsanat (the chaste women with known family background) from amongst Al-Mominat, and Al-Muhsanat from amongst Al-Lazina-ootul-Kitab (the people who were given Al-Kitab) before you (are made lawful to you, for marriage as wives) when you have paid them their Ujoor (thus proving yourself as) Muhseneen (desirous of maintaining a permanent family link), not being Musafeheen, and not being that who picks up temporary friends and companions. And whoever rejects or will reject Faith (in the Teachings in Al-Kitab) then definitely he has destroyed his act (of starting a family-life in marriage) and he, in the Hereafter, will be from amongst the losers"
