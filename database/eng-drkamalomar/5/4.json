    "text": "They would ask you what is that which has been made lawful for them (as food). Say: â€œAt-Tayyibat are made lawful to you; as well as which you taught Al-Jawareh; (acting as)Mokallebin. You teach them (i.e., to your Al-Jawareh, including dogs and hounds as well as the birds of prey called falcons) out of what Allah has made known to you (that the hunting animal should only seize the prey, shall not eat or consume it and shall not harbour the desire to devour it directly). So eat out of what they have seized and brought for you, and do pronounce the name of Allah over it (while you give a cut at the carotid arteries of the neck to provide an easy exit to the free blood available in the body of the prey); and pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is swift in accountability"
