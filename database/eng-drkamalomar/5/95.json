    "text": "O you who have Believed! Kill not game while you are those ‘under prohibition’ (i.e., you are within the Harem or putting on Ehram for Hajj or Umra); and whoever killed it from amongst you intentionally (and not by oversight or mistake), the penalty is equivalent to what he killed, in the form of a quadruped animal — two just men from amongst you shall give judgement about it; Hadiya (gift-animal to be sacrificed) which is one that reaches the Ka’ba; or expiation could be given as food to the poor, or equivalent to this (could be keeping of) fasts so that he (i.e., the game-hunter) may taste the punishment for his deed. Allah has forgiven what happened before but whoever repeated, then Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Able of retribution"
