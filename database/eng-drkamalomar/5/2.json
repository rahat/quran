    "text": "O you people who have Believed! Violate not the sanctity of Sha’irullah [Signs and symbols (of obedience to) Allah] that is, neither of the Protected Month, and nor of Al-Hadiya (Animal proceeding to the Kaba for sacrifice); and neither the necklaces or collars (that such animals are putting on), and nor of those who are proceeding to the Sacred, Protected and Prohibited House — they seek the Bounty proceeding from their Nourisher-Sustainer and (His) agreement and pleasure. And when you have become free of prohibitions (i.e., you put off Ehram and you are outside the limits of Harem-area, only) then you indulge in game of hunting. And shall not lead you the hatred (exhibited) by a nation that they obstructed you from reaching, The Sacred, Protected and Prohibited Mosque — that you indulge in hostility or transgression (on your part). Assist one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa, and do not help one another in sin and transgression. And pay obedience to Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in giving punishment"
