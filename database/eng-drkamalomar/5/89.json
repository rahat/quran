    "text": "Allah will not make you accountable for (what is) unintentional in your oaths, but He will make you accountable what you committed deliberate (in your) oaths. (If you break such an oath) then its expiation (would be) feeding ten poor persons out of the average what you feed your own family-members; or providing them garments; or (drafting) a document for (providing freedom to) one (human) neck (which is in slavery). But whosoever does not find (himself in a position to pay such an expiation) then (he shall keep) fasts for three days. This is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn. But it shall be better if you protect your oaths (provided they are not undesirable). Thus Allah explains to you His Ayaat so that you may be grateful"
