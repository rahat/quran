They manipulate the word from its (due) places and have abandoned a considerable portion out of that with which they were given the Message. And you will not cease â€” you will continue to discover deceit in them, except (for) a few in them. So forgive them and overlook (there misdeeds). Verily, Allah loves those who exceed in goodness"
