    "text": "O you the Messenger! Shall not make you grieve those who show haste in disbelief out of those who said: “We have Believed”, with their mouths but their hearts do not Believe. And out of those who Haadoo (act as) listeners to falsehood acting as listeners for a nation of other people who have not come to you. They disturb a statement after (it has already been put at) its due places. They say: “If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then take protection (against it). And (for) whosoever: Allah desires his trial, then you posses not for him from Allah, anything. They are those, Allah does not intend that He may purify their hearts. For them, in the world (is) disgrace, and for them, in the Hereafter (is) a great punishment"
