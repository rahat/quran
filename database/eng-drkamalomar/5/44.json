    "text": "Verily, We! We sent down the Taurat. In it (is) guidance and light. The Prophets who submitted to Islam, pronounce judgement based on this (Taurat) for those who Haadoo (became Jews). And likewise do those who are attached to the Nourisher-Sustainer; and (also) those who are scholars — because they have been entrusted the protection of Kitab-ullahe (Allah’s Book), and they are, thereto (as) witnesses. So fear not mankind, but fear Me. And do not purchase with My Verses a meagre sum. And whoever did not pronounce judgement in accordance with what Allah has sent down, then those people: they (are the ones who are) Al-kafirun"
