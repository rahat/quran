    "text": "Allah has established the Ka’ba, the Sacred, protected and prohibited House as an Asylum and Rendesvous for mankind (for Hajj, Umra, Tawaf and Salat) and the protected month, and Al-Hadiya, and the garlands (that encircle the necks of gift-animals that are proceeding to the Ka’ba). This, (He has done) that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that Allah is All-Knower of each and every thing. [If one performs pre-Hajj Umra in Hajj-season and also attends Hajj, or breaks certain prohibitions related to Harem, Umra and Hajj, he has to offer animal-sacrifice]"
