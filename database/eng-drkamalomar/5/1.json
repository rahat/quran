Grazing quadrupeds (the four footed animals who eat grass) are declared lawful to you (for food) except what is recited to you (herein) without being those who permit game while you (people) are under prohibition (due to being within the area called Harem, or you are putting on the uniform dress called Ehram). Verily, Allah commands what He wills"
