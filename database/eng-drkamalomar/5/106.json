    "text": "O you who have Believed! The testimony (or acceptable evidence) amongst you, when death approached any one of you, at the time of bequest, (shall be) two just men of your own (folk), or two others from outside your own (circle) if you are travelling through the land and the calamity of death has approached you. Detain both of them after As-Salat, then both shall swear by Allah — if you doubted — (saying): “We shall not barter this (testimony) for a sum even though he (i.e., the beneficiary) be our near relative. And we shall not hide testimony of Allah, certainly we in that position, surely (become) out of the sinful ones.”"
