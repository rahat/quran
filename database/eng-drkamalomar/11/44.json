Withhold (your rain).” And the water was made to recede and subside and the Decree (of Allah) was implemented (and all the disbelievers perished in the deluge), and it (i.e., the Ark) anchored at judi [the word refers to a (comparatively) green and fertile land] and it was said: “Barrier (to mercy) for the nation of the transgressors!”"
