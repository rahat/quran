    "text": "(The angels) said: “O Lout! Verily, we are the messengers from your Nourisher-Sustainer. They shall never reach you. So move with your family-members in the (terminal) part of the night, and must not any of you stay back, except your wife. Certainly, it (i.e., the punishment is) the one which is reaching her (also) what has reached them. Surely, the appointed time for them is the morning. Is not the morning very near?”"
