Have you pondered if I am on Bayyinah) from my Nourisher-Sustainer and He has provided me sustenance from Himself — a palatable and lawful provision — (shall I corrupt it by mixing it with illegally and immorally earned money)? And I do not intend that I may go against you, to that which I forbid you there unto. I do not intend except reform whatever I had the capacity. And there is no capacity (or ability) in me except through Allah. In Him I put my trust and unto Him I turn (for help and guidance)"
