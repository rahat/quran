    "text": "Or there may be for you a house of gold, or you ascend up into the sky, and (even then) we shall never put faith in your ascension until you make descend over us a book that we may read.” Say: “Glorified be my Nourisher-Sustainer! What am I except a man (sent as a) Messenger?” [Therefore you should not expect any of such acts being performed by the Messenger, and you should not develop faith in any such incidents which may be fabricated in man-written books about me]"
