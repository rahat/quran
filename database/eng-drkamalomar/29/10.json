    "text": "And of mankind (is that) who says: “We have Believed in Allah,” then when he was made to suffer ‘in (the Cause of) Allah’, he regarded the test and trial at the hands of humans like a punishment from Allah. And surely, if there came assistance from your Nourisher-Sustainer (leading to a Muslim victory), surely (the hypocrites will immediately) say: “Verily, we have remained alongwith you (Muslims)!” Is then not Allah more aware of what is in the chests of the worlds"
