So out of them is that We sent unto him Hasiban (a violent wind with shower of stones); and of them is that â€” As-Saiha (an awful cry or a monstrous sound) seized him; and of them is that We made the earth slide in with him, and of them is that we drowned (in the waters). And Allah was not that He will do injustice to them but they used to do injustice to themselves"
