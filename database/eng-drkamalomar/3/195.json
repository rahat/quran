Some of you (are) from some (others). So those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes, and have been persecuted in My Cause, and they indulged in war and were killed, surely I will write off from them their omissions and would surely admit them into Gardens, flow under them rivers â€” a reward from the Presence of Allah. And Allah! With Him (is found) the excellence of reward"
