Certainly I delivered that (as) a female (child),” — and Allah (is always) a Better Knower about what she delivered, and the male (child she had in her mind) would not have (fulfilled the role) the way the female (fulfilled); “and certainly I, I have given her the name, Maryam, and certainly I put her to protection, to You (O Allah,) and (also) her offspring against (the evil effects of) Satan, the outcast.”"
