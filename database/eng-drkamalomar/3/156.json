Be not like those who have disbelieved and said about their brethren when they travelled through the earth, or were those who fight (in Allah’s Way): “If they had been with us, they would not have died and would not have been killed,” so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. And (it is) Allah That gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
