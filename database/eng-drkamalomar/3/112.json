    "text": "They are smitten with vileness wheresoever they are found, except (when) under a covenant from Allah and a covenant from men. And they have drawn (on themselves) the wrath of Allah, and they are smitten with indignity. This (engulfed them) because they had been rejecting the Ayaat of Allah and had been assassinating the Prophets (in personality) without right. This is because they disobeyed and used to transgress (the limits, set by Allah)"
