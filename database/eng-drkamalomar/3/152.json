    "text": "And indeed, Allah did fulfill to you His promise when you are annihilating them under His permission; until when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order, and you disobeyed after what He showed you which you cherish. Amongst you (is) that who desires this world and amongst you (is) that who desires the Hereafter. Then He separated you from them so that He may assess you. And certainly He forgave you. And Allah is (Full) of Grace to the Believers"
