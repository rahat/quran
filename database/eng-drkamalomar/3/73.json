(Do you fear) that a certain one is bestowed similar to that what has been bestowed on you or (that) they make arguments against you before your Nourisher-Sustainer?” Say (further): “Certainly the bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He grants to whom He thinks proper. And Allah is Omnipresent, Omniscient.”"
