    "text": "And hold fast to the Rope of Allah (i.e., His Al-Kitab) as a group and divide not into sects, and bring to mind and discuss Allahâ€™s grace on you when you were enemies (unto each other) but He put love and attachment in between your hearts, so you became, by His grace, brethren. And you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, then He saved you from it. Thus Allah explains for you His statements, perchance you may receive guidance"
