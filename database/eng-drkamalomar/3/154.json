    "text": "Then He sent on you, after the (phase of) stress, a state of peace in the form of slumber — it overtakes a group amongst you. And (another) group: their selves made them anxious — they imagine about Allah, other than reality, (i.e., ) an imagination based on ignorance. They say: “Is there for us, in the affair, any say?” Tell (them): “Indeed, the affair — the whole of it belongs to Allah.” They hide within themselves what they do not reveal to you.

And so that Allah makes assessment of what is in your chests, and so that He purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Aware about the condition of (the contents of) the chests"
