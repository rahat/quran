    "text": "And (remember) Zun-Nun (Yunus) when he moved away (from his nation) as one who is in anger, and he felt sure that We shall never assess the situation against him (i.e., against his decision). So he cried out in the darknesses (of the mammal’s belly) that: “There is no god except You. Glorified be You! Truly, I have been of those who are wrong in decision.”"
