    "text": "So you people are indeed those individuals: you are called upon that you may spend in the Cause of Allah. So amongst you is that who behaves as a niggardly person. And whosoever behaves as niggardly, so surely what (is a fact is that) he becomes niggardly against his own Nafs. And Allah is the Self-Sufficient while you are the needy. And if you will turn back He will bring in place a nation other than you, then they will not be your likes"
