    "text": "When you became interlocked (in an armed encounter) with those who disbelieved, then smiting the necks (becomes obligatory) until the stage when you have fully subdued them. Then firmly establish the process of arrest. Then if whatever generosity (is to be done, it would be done) later on; and if whatever ransom (is to be eccepted it also would process later on. Generosity or ransom do not apply) untill the war lays down its burdens (i.e., it has completely exhausted its fury). That (is the Law). And if Allah desires, He will surely implement retribution on them; but (He prefers a bitter fight) so that He may test some of you through some (others). And those who are slain in the Way of Allah â€” so He will never let their deeds be lost (or go in vain)"
