    "text": "The example of the Garden which has been promised to the righteous individuals: therein are rivers of water, not that which changes (its colour, taste or smell), and rivers of milk whose taste changes not, and rivers of fermented liquid — a delight to those who may sip, and rivers of honey — purified and cleansed. And for them, therein are available from all kinds of fruits as well as forgiveness proceeding from their Nourisher-Sustainer. (Is such a righteous individual) like that who is an abider in the Fire? And they were made to drink very hot water, so it cut off their intestines"
