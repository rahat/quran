When it is told unto you: â€œMake a place (to accommodate others) in the gatherings, then do create a place (for others); Allah will provide a place for you (under His Mercy). And when it has been announced: 'Disperse', then rise up and move. Allah will elevate those who have Believed amongst you. And for those who have been given Knowledge (are) ranks (much higher). And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do"
