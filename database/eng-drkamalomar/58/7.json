    "text": "Have you not seen that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth? Does not take place a secret discussion among three individuals (troika) but He is the Fourth over them, and nor of five individuals but He is the Sixth over them; and neither less than this, and nor more, but He is alongwith them wherever they happened to be (in discussion). Afterwards He will inform them of that which they did, on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Allah is All-Knower of everything"
