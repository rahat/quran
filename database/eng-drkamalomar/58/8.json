    "text": "Have you not seen towards those who were forbidden to hold secret talks, afterwards they return to that they were prohibited thereof? And they indulge in secret discussion among themselves — in sin and opposition, and disobedience of the Messenger. And when they approached you, they greeted you with the words with which Allah greets you not. And they say unto themselves: “Why does not Allah punish us for what we utter?” Sufficient is unto them Hell — they will proceed to it; so an evil destination (indeed)"
