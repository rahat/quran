[During certain months every year the day-portion is stripped off and replaced by the dark hours â€” i.e., the sun rises late and sets early. But this replacement of the day-time by the dark-hours can even occur of a sudden due to other phenomenon like eclipse of the sun, or raven-dark clouds that may hide the sun during the day-time]"
