Pay obedience to your Nourisher-Sustainer and be afraid of the Day when does not benefit a father unto his son, and nor the son (is one that) he pays any thing for the redemption on behalf of his father. Verily, the Promise of Allah is true. Let not then this worldly life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver (Iblis) deceive you about Allah"
