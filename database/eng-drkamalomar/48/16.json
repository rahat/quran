    "text": "Say to those who lagged behind out of the bedouins: “Soon you shall be called upon to a nation given to great warfare. They shall either fight you in an armed encounter, or they shall seek peace (with you). So if you pay obedience Allah will pay you a fair reward; and if you turned away as you have turned back on previous occasion, He will put you to punishment — of a painful torment.”"
