    "text": "When those who disbelieved had placed in their hearts the pride and haughtiness â€” pride and haughtiness based on ignorance, then Allah made to descend His Sakinah upon His Messenger and upon the Believers. And He kept them attached to the statement of obedience (La-ilaha-ill-Allah Muhammadun Rasulullah. See Verses 37/35, 48/29), and they were more entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knower of every thing"
