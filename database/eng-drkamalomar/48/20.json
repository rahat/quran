    "text": "Allah has given you a promise regarding abundant spoils of war; you will receive it (in some coming encounter); so He has hastened for you this (immediate success) and He has restrained the hands of (the enemical) people from you (through a treaty of peace signed within the belly of Makka. See Verse No. 24). And (this He appreciated) so that it (i.e., the signing of a peace treaty to overcome adverse conditions and periods) becomes a Sign for the Believers; and in order that He may guide you to Siratam Mustaqim"
