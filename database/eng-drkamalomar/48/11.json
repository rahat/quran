    "text": "Soon will say unto you those who lagged behind out of the bedouins: “Our possessions kept us involved; so ask forgiveness for us.” They utter with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: “Who then will have any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah, if He intended you (any) harm or He intended you (any) benefit? Nay, Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
