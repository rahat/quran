Do you twain hold out a promise to me that I shall be raised up (alive after becoming a part of the dust and mud), and surely, the generations have passed away before me (but none has risen from the dead)?” While those two (the father and the mother) both invoke Allah for help (and admonish their son thus): “What a pitty for you! Develop Faith, surely the Promise of Allah is true.” Still he utters: “This (Al-Kitab) is not but written records of the initial people.”"
