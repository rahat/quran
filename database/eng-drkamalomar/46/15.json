    "text": "We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: in pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. And the gestation-period for him and the weaning of him (make) thirty months — until when he attained his full strength and attained forty years, he said, “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Bestow me (the power) that I may pay thanks for Your favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may perform righteous deeds that You may agree with it; and make reform in my offspring for my sake. Truly, I have turned to You, and truly I am (one) of the Muslims.”"
