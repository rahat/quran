[These are those missionaries, preachers and messengers who call people towards the Ayaat of Al-Kitab and also see that the people who revert to Islam, stay in Islam in satisfaction, and with full inclination of hearts]. And (these are to be spent) in (arranging the freedom of) the necks (from all sorts of bondage of slavery and dependence), and for those in debts, and for the Cause of Allah and (for) a victim of travel (i.e., any traveller who has accidentally become a needy person) â€” (this is the) ordainment coming from Allah. And Allah is All-Aware, All-Wise"
