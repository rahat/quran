    "text": "Certainly it is, that Nasi [interchanging or replacement (of a protected month by one which is not protected)] amounts to going deeper in disbelief; thereby the disbelievers are led astray. They make it (a certain month) permissible (to initiate an armed encounter) one year and make it (another certain month) prohibited (to initiate an armed encounter therein) in (another) year in order to adjust the number of the months prohibited by Allah (and) so (that) they may make Halal (permissible) what Allah has declared Haram (prohibited). (There is) made alluring to them the evil of their deeds. And Allah does not guide the nation of disbelievers"
