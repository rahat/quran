    "text": "They swear by Allah what they said (as if they uttered nothing objectionable), although surely, they uttered a statement of disbelief, and they disbelieved after their (accepting) Islam and they resolved which they could not accomplish, and they did not retaliate except that Allah and His Messenger enriched them out of His bounty. And if they repent (and adopt the right Path) it will be better for them, and if they turned back, Allah will punish them with a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And there will not be for them in the world a wali (supporter, protector) â€” and nor a helper"
