    "text": "And (there is) an Announcement from Allah and His Messenger to mankind (on the) Youm (‘Day’, the afternoon of the 9th Day of the closing month of the lunar year) of Al-Hajj-il-Akbar that Allah is free from (all) obligations to the Mushrikun, and (so is) His Messenger. So if you (Mushrikun) repented (and returned to the teachings of Al-Kitab) then it (is) better for you, and if you turned away (as polytheists or pagans), then know that you are not one who can frustrate Allah. And give tidings to those who have disbelieved for a painful torment"
