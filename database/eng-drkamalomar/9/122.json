So why not marched out from all sections amongst them a group (so that they who are scholars, they stay out of the encounters) so that they may think over about Religion, and so that they may warn their nation (against undesirable behaviour) when they returned back to these (scholars at their parent place of residence), so that they (the Muslim nation) may fully guard (against evil beliefs, concepts and practices)"
