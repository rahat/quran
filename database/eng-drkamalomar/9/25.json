    "text": "Truly, Allah provided you aid and assistance on many lands and on the Day of Sympathetic Mercy when your great number (in comparison to the invading infidels) made you bewitched and over-confident; but it did not make you avail any thing and constricted against you the earth (allowing you no link with your people) inspite of how expanded (it stood). Then you retreated showing your backs (and Allah proved on you that dependence on the great number or vastness of armaments are not the main factors for any encounter)"
