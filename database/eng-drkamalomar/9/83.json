    "text": "So if Allah brought you back to a group of them then they asked your permission to move out (to take part in the encounters), then say: “Never shall you move out with me — forever, and never you would indulge in Qital on my side, with the enemy. Surely, you felt satisfied in sitting unconcerned on the first occasion. So sit unconcerned alongwith those who stay behind (due to illness or invalidity).”"
