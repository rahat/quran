That is because they: there reaches not them thirst, and nor fatigue and nor helplessness in hunger in the cause of Allah, and they do not march through a track (in the form of a military column) which enrages the disbelievers, and they do not take from the enemy any gain — but there is written in their account through it a clean and desirable act. Verily, Allah does not allow to go unimplemented the reward of those who do good in perfection"
