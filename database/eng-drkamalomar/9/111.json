    "text": "Verily, Allah has purchased of the Believers their persons and their possessions that for them shall be the Paradise, they make Qital in the cause of Allah, so (sometimes) they kill and (at another time) they are killed. Promise about this is a truth â€” in At-Taurat, and Al-Injeel, and Al-Quran. And that who fulfills more his covenant with Allah: then take glad tidings for your bargain which you bargained with Him. And that: that (very one) is the supreme achievement"
