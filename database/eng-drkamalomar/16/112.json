    "text": "And Allah brought forward the example of a township: it was in complete security, fully content (what it received), its provisions come to it in abundance from all places. Then it denied the bounties of Allah (by becoming a prey to Satanic influences and adopting undesirable way of life), so Allah made it taste an atmosphere of hunger (due to poverty or famine) and fear (due to lawlessness and terrorism) because of that which they used to invent and involve (themselves therein)"
