    "text": "And Allah has made in your interest out of that which He has created, shades; and He has made for you in the mountains places of refuge; and He has made in your interest garments — these protect you from the heat, and (military) garments — these protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus He perfects His grace unto you so that you may submit yourselves (as Muslims in Islam)"
