    "text": "And be not you people like that (Ummah or Community) which undid (or untied) her yarn, after (attaining) power (i.e., getting properly spun in the form) into loose, isolated threads. You regard your oaths a means of deception amongst you (for fear) lest an Ummah become that which is greater than (another) Ummah. Surely, what (is the fact is that) Allah puts you to a test and trial therewith. And indeed, He will make completely clear to you on the Day of Resurrection (all) that wherein you used to differ"
