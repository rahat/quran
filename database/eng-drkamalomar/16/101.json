The majority of them do not know. [It is only the Divine Scripture which has scattered the teachings on any particular subject throughout its Text. This style is not found in any human book. Therefore when one delivers the statements to his pupil on one particular subject-matter, he delivers them collectively. The teacher has to pick up the Verses from different places to make the student understand the matter. The people who are ignorant in this matter apply a charge of forgery to the teacher who teaches in this manner]"
