    "text": "And what you gave (to people) out of Riba (usury) so that it increases in the wealth of (these) people â€” so, (listen clearly) it shall not increase (or multiply) in the assessment of Allah. And whatever you give out of Zakat: you intend and desire attention of Allah, then those people: they (are those) who enlarge and multiply (their wealth). [Assistance provided out of usury-money shall benefit no one, while assistance provided from Zakat shall add to and cause increase in the wealth of the recipient]"
