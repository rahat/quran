    "text": "Their Messengers said: “What ! (Could there be) a doubt about Allah, the Initiator of the heavens and the earth? He invites you (to the way of life given in His Al-Kitâb) so that He may forgive you your sins and may allow you to prolong your stay (on the land) for a term appointed.” They said: “You are not but a human being like us. You intend that you turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. So bring us a clear authority.”"
