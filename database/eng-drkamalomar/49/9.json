Then if one of them went beyond limits against the other, then fight that (group) which crosses the limits until that (group) takes a turn to the ordainment of Allah. Then if the (erring group) complied, then make reconciliation between those two with justice, and be equitable. Surely, Allah likes those who behave in equality"
