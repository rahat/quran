And nor (shall scoff) women at (some other) women, may be that (the latter) are better than those (former, who scoffed). And do not defame your own persons, and do not insult one another by (allotting ridiculous) titles (or nicknames). (What) an evil is the name indicating Fusuq after (one has attained) the Faith. And whosoever does not desist and repent, then those people: they (very ones are) Az-Zalimun"
