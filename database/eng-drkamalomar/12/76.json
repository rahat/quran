    "text": "So, (Yusuf) began (the search) through their bags before the bag of his (real) brother. Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Yusuf. (It) was not (possible for Yusuf) that he may detain his brother under the law (and constitution) of Al-Malik, except when Allah wills it. We raise in ranks whom We think proper. And over all those endued with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah)"
