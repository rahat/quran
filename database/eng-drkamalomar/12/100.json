    "text": "And he brought his parents up on the throne and they (i.e., the father, the mother, the brother-german and the ten half-brothers — altogether) fell down prostrate (before Allah) in appreciation to him (when they witnessed the position and high rank of Yusuf). And (Yusuf) said: “O my dear father! This (becomes) the interpretation (in physical form) of my dream (which I saw as vision) before. Indeed, my Nourisher-Sustainer has made it a reality. And indeed, He did kindness to me when He brought me out of the prison, and He came with you (all) out of the rural-area, after Satan had sown enmity between me and between my brothers. Certainly, my Nourisher-Sustainer is (the) Keenest Observer for whom He thinks proper. Truly He! Only He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise"
