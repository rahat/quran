Do not enter (all) through one entrance, rather enter through different gates, and I am of no benefit to you against Allah (if He has some adverse plans) in any way. The decision is not (a legitimate right) except for Allah. In Him I have put my trust. And in Him, let all, who entrust the trust, put their trust.”"
