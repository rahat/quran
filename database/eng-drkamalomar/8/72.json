And those who Believed and did not emigrate: (there is) not to you out of (any responsibility) for their protection in any form until they emigrate. But if they seek your help in Religion then it is your responsibility (to provide) help — except bypassing a nation when there is between you and between them a treaty (prohibiting such a help). And Allah is All-Seer of what you do"
