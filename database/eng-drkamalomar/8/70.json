Tell to that who is in your hands out of the prisoners (of war): “If Allah knows in your hearts (any) good, He will give you better than what has been taken away from you; (may be Allah grants you Faith as a very handsome reward during your captivity), and He may grant Forgiveness for you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful.”"
