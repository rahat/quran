    "text": "(O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, then surely the judgment has reached you. And if you cease (your armed encounter with the Believing military forces), then it will be better for you; and if you counter-attack, We shall (definitely) retaliate and your group shall avail nothing to you even though it became overwhelmingly large. And (be careful) that Allah is with the Believers"
