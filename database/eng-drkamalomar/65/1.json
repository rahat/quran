    "text": "O you An-Nabi! When you divorced women, then divorce them keeping full regard for their iddat (waiting period) and correctly count the iddat. And pay obedience to Allah, Nourisher-Sustainer unto you. Do not make them go from their residence (where they are living uptil now with their husbands), and they shall not go (even on their own) — except (under punishment) that they indulge in evident lewdness. And these are the limits of Allah. And whoever overrides the limits of Allah, then surely he had committed transgression against his (own) Nafs. You (who could pronounce divorce unto wife) do not comprehend — may be Allah brings out an absolutely new situation after this (for handling) the matter (and thus make you understand the benefit and the philosophy regarding the iddat)"
