And arrange for the testimony of two just persons from amongst you (Muslims). And preserve the evidence for Allah (i.e., you should give it the form of a document bearing the signatures or impressions of two witnesses). This unto you, He admonishes therewith that one who used to Believe in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever pays obedience to Allah, He will make for him a way out (for every difficult situation)"
