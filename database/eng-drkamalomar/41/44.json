    "text": "And if We had made it a Quran in a not fully comprehensive language (i.e., any language other than Arabic), people would have said: “Why not its Verses are armed with details? What! (A Book) not in Arabic, and (the Messenger) an Arab?” Say: “It is for those who have Believed — a Guide and a Healing. As for those who do not believe, there is a block in their ears. And it (i.e., the Quran) unto them is blindness, and they feel they are called from a very far away place”. [They are so ignorant and misinformed of the Quran that when its teachings are brought before them, their eyes get blind and their ears appear partially deaf]"
