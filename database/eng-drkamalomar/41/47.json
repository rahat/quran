And does not come out of its sheath any of the fruits; and does not conceive any one of the females, and nor she delivers, but with His Knowledge. And the Day He calls unto them: “Where (have gone) My (so-called) partners?” They said: “We have informed You — there is not from amongst us (any one) out of a witness (to our false claims that You had partners in Your Dominion).”"
