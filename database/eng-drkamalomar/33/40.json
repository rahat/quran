    "text": "Muhammad became not a father to any male-adult amongst you, but Rasul-ullah and Khatama-n-Nabiyyin. ['a seal (of closure unto the coming) of the prophets'. 'He closed (the coming of) the prophets'. (The pronunciation 'khatam/khatama' is a noun/verb and thus acts as a double shield or protection to his status and position)]. And Allah is All-Aware of everything. [He Knows fully well that Muhammad is His final, last and closing Prophet; and also that he left no legacy in the form of male-offspring to continue his race or descendence in this world]"
