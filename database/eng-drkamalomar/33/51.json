    "text": "Refrain from whom you think proper out of those women, and allow unto you whom you think proper. And whomsoever you desired out of those whom you seperated temporarily from closeup — then (there is) no blame on you; that is nearer that their eyes may find solace, and these females may not get depressed, and they may feel pleased with what you provided them — all of them. And Allah knows what (resides) in your hearts. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, Most Forbearing"
