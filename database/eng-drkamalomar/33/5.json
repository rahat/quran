But in case you do not know their fathers (or their names), then (call them) your brothers in Faith and Mawaleekum (those under your custodianship and protection). And there is (counted) no sin against you in what you made a mistake therein, but (it would be a sin) what your hearts deliberately attempted. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful (and Forgives what is past and is not repeated)"
