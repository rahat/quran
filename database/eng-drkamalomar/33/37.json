    "text": "And when you say to him (i.e., to Zaid who is an adopted son) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace, and you have (also) bestowed grace on him: “Retain your wife with you (in wedlock) and remain dutiful to Allah.\" And you hide in your self for which Allah is One Who will make it evident, and you are afraid of people, while Allah has more right that you may fear Him. So when Zaid broke the marital link with her, We paired you with her (i.e., We arranged your marriage to the divorced wife of your adopted son) — so that there remains no blame on the Believers about (tahead of state in their own wedlock the ex-) wives of their (own) adopted sons when (the latter) have broken marital links with such women. And Allah’s Verdict got fulfilled"
