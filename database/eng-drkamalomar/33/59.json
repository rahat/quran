    "text": "O you An-Nabi! Tell your consorts and your daughters and the women of the Believers (that) they should draw close to them their Jalabib (this is a plural of Jilbab. It could be any additional outer-garment like a shawl, a cloak, a gown or an apron). That will be an (extra-precaution) nearer (to this) that they may be recognised (as their full face shall remain uncovered), but they may not be teased or harmed (as they are modestly dressed). [A practical application of this ordainment is always visible in those who are at Umra or are attending the Hajj-Congregation]. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
