Whoever of you females comes with an evident obscenity Al-azab (this refers to the punishment of Zina as given in Verse 24/2, 8) would be doubled for her (as a further deterrent to those who should present their example as a pattern for the whole nation). And that is very easy for Allah (to make it implemented)"
