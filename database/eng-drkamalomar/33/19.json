    "text": "(Thus they prove themselves to be) more greedy against you. Then when fear overwhelmed, you saw them: they look at you, their eyes revolve hither and thither like someone on whom death has been set hovering. But when the fear departed, they smote you with sharp tongues being more greedy for wealth (expected out of the spoils of war). Those people have not developed Faith, so Allah made their deeds and actions to go waste, and that is very easy for Allah"
