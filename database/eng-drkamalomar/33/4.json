    "text": "Allah has not placed for any man two hearts inside his thorax; and He has not made your wives as your mothers whom: unto whom you utter ‘Az-Zihar’ [the ‘game of backs’ (i.e., you call their backs as the backs of your mothers and then discontinue marital relations with them)]. And He has not regarded your adopted ones (or your called-ones) as your (real) sons. This, for you, is your own statement emitted by your mouths, while Allah gives the True statement and He guides to the (Permanent) Path"
