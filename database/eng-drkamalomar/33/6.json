    "text": "An-Nabi is closer to the Believers than their ownselves, and his wives are (like) mothers to them (as regards respect and marriage). And the possessors of (the links through) the wombs (i.e., blood-relations): some of them are closer (in personal ties) to some in Kitabullah [Book of Allah (regarding the heirship in inheritance)] than (the brotherhood of) the Believers and Al-Muhajirun (those who, become emigrants in the cause of Allah) â€” except that you do kindness in some desirable way to those in friendly bonds to you. This became written in Al-Kitab"
