    "text": "O you who have Believed! Enter not the houses of An-Nabi, except when permission is given to you for a meal, without being those who have an eye on its preparation. But when you are invited then (only) you enter. Then when you have taken (your) meal, immediately disperse and be not Mustanesun for hadees (narration). Verily, such (a behaviour) from you used to annoy and hurt An-Nabi, but he hesitates regarding you, but Allah hesitates not regarding the truth. And when you ask those women for any thing, then ask those women from behind a screen. This (behaviour) from you (would be) purer for your hearts as well as for the hearts of these women. And it suits you not that you may hurt and annoy Rasul-ullah (Messenger of Allah), and nor that you may bring in (your) wedlock his wives after him â€” ever. Verily, this (attempt) of yours shall be, in the Sight of Allah, enormity"
