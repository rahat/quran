When Ibrahim said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer is That Who gives life and He brings death.” (The ruler) said: “I give life and I give death.\" Ibrahim said: “So, certainly, Allah comes with the sun from the East. So do come you, with it, from the West!” Thus was made stunned who had rejected and disbelieved. And Allah does not guide the nation of transgressors"

He said: “How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death?” Then Allah gave him death lasting a hundred years. Then He revived and raised him up. (Allah) asked: “How long have you stayed?” He said: “I have stayed a day or part of a day.” Allah said: “Nay! You have stayed for a hundred years. So look at your food and your drink: it has not decomposed! And look at your ass (which is dead, the body is decomposed and the only remains are bare bones with no sign of flesh over them)! And so that We may make you a sign and proof for mankind (to understand the phenomenon of Resurrection). And look at the bones (of your ass) how We separate (to reset) them; then We cover them in flesh!” Then when the process got explained to him he said: “I do understand that certainly Allah is All-Capable over every thing.”"
