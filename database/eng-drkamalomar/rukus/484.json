Without any doubt I am Rasulullah (Messenger of Allah) unto you — as a confirmer and verifier for that which is inbetween my two hands as Taurat; and as Mubasshir (one who transmits glad news in advance) about a Rasul (Messenger) — he comes after me, his name (would be) Ahmad.” So when he came to them (whom Iesa was addressing, i.e., Bani Israiel) alongwith Al-Bayyinat (‘The Evidently clear items’) they (i.e., Bani Israiel) said: “This (Al-Bayyinat) is evident magic.” [Please refer Verses 2/87, 253; 5/110; and 43/63 where Iesa comes alongwith Al-Bayyinat. Allah’s Book is permanent and immune to change. It has made itself evident to each and every Prophet of God. It is being propagated to mankind since Day-one and continues to be propagated till the Last Day. This very Book shall examine all mankind individually on the Day of Accountability. Note that the word Taurat has been used as an attribute for Al-Kitab which Prophet Iesa holds in his hand and is propagating to his people. Also note that the word Taurat, although present at 18 places in Allah’s Book, has nowhere been used as an attribute for Al-Kitab in relation to Prophet Musa! Please note that this new Rasul comes after Iesa and not the vice versa]"
