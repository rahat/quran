And (it is also forbidden) that you create union between two sisters (by simultaneously tahead of state them in wedlock) except (i.e., leaving as it is) what has already occurred; verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"

And has been made lawful to you whatever is to you outside this (class) — that you may seek (them in marriage) with your wealth (and possessions) harbouring intention to remain in bond without (being those) who have fluid, temporary or shifting intentions. So what you enjoyed and benefited by this (bond of marriage) through those women (as your wives), then deliver to them their rewards made compulsory (by Allah).

So take those (daughters) in wedlock with the permission of the protecting guardian to these females [The protecting guardian to these females is the person in whose right hands has been placed the mother of these females]; and pay them their bridal money in a desirable way. (They should have the intention of staying as) protected females living in bond of marriage (and) not women who harbour fluid, temporary or shifting intentions, and not those women who pick up boy-friends (or lovers or paramours). And when they are provided protection (in marriage-bond) and if they come as one who is involved in the vulgar act (of adultery) — then, for them (is) the half (of) that which is applicable to Al-Muhsanat as Al-Azab (this is the punishment of flogging mentioned in 24/2–9). This (permission, that a free man living fully protected in a family background may marry of his own free will a female whose family background has become unknown is) for that amongst you who became afraid of falling in sin (of committing pre-marital sex if he remains unmarried). And that you practice self-restraint — would be better for you. And Allah (is) Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
