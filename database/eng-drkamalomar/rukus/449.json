Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid-al-Haram, if Allah thought proper, as attainers of peace, (and as) those who have submitted their heads to a clean-shave, and (as) those who (got their scalp-hair) trimmed. You will feel no fear. So He knew what you knew not, that is why He sanctioned instead of this Fathan Qariban ['an immediate success.' (This Fathan Qariban is the treaty of peace signed in the belly of Makka which makes the Believers to interrupt the programme of attending the Hajj and also stops them from offering Animal-Sacrifice at the proper place meant and specified for it)][Please note that attending to the haircut is compulsory before initiating the 2nd part of the Hajj-Congregation]"

You see them bowing, and falling down in prostration (while in Prayer). They seek the Bounty from Allah and (His) Assents and Agreements. Their marks (are evident) in their facies from the effect of the submissions. This (becomes) their example in At-Taurat, and (another) example for them in Al-Injeel: like a (sown) seed which sent out its shoot, then made it firm, then it became thick, then it stood (straight and stable) on its stem. (Now) it puts the sower to wonder — that He may enrage the disbelievers because of these (happy sowers). Allah has promised those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds amongst them — forgiveness and a mighty reward"
