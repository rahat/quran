            "text": "Surely, your Nourisher-Sustainer comes to know that you continue to stand (in late-night Prayer) a little less than 2/3rd of the night, and (sometimes) half of it (i.e., the later half of the night), and (sometimes) one third (1/3rd) of it (i.e., the terminal 1/3rd of the night if we count the period from sunset to the break of dawn) — and a group out of those (Believers) who are with you (also join you in Tahajjud Prayers). And Allah assesses the (utility of the) night and the day. He knew (beforehand) that you will never bear it (without getting over-tired), so He has turned to you in affection. So recite as became easy, out of Al-Qur‘an. He knew that soon there would be among you sick people, and others will travel through the earth, they will seek out of the Bounty of Allah; and (still) others will take part in Qital for the Cause of Allah. So recite as became easy out of it and establish As-Salat and pay-up Zakat, and lend to Allah Qarzan Hasanan. And whatever you send in advance for yourselves in the form of Khair (commendable deeds), you will find it with Allah; it (will be) something extremely good and greater as a reward. And seek Forgiveness from Allah. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
