So now have sexual relations with them and seek (the pleasure or progeny) whatever Allah has written for you. And continue to eat and drink until becomes evident to you the white linear area from the dark linear area (on the sky) at the break of dawn. Then complete the fasts till it is night (and the sun is no more visible). And do not have sexual relations with them while you are in Itikaf in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so don’t stand at its edge. Thus Allah explains His statements for mankind so that they may become Al-Muttaqun"
