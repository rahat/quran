Approach not salat when you are drunk until you are aware of what you will utter (in recitations during the act of Prayer), and nor in a state of impurity (due to emission of sexual fluid) — except (when you are a) passerby (on the) road (because there you may not be able to have a bath and change spoilt clothes) — until you arrange a wash. And if you are people down with disease or on a journey, or one of you has come out of the toilet or you have made sexual contact with women and you find not water — then you people utilize clean clay (to soak the emissions and clean the part); then rub (with some additional clean dust) your faces and your hands (upto the wrists). Surely, Allah is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving. [ See Note alongside]"
