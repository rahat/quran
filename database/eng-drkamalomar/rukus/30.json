And it is not lawful to you that you may retain anything out of what you have given to these women (any time in married life) except when a (particular) pair apprehends that the pair can not honour the conditions ordained by Allah (as the requirements of a married life). Then if you feared that these two would not abide by the ordainments of Allah, then there is no sin on (either of) these two in what she (i.e., the wife) paid to him (i.e., the husband) as ransom to this (pronouncement of divorce by husband against his will, only on wife’s initiative). These are the limits set by Allah, then override them not. And one who overrides the limits set by Allah, then such are those who are transgressors"

Then, if (this other husband) divorced her, then there is no obstruction for these two (i.e., the woman and her first husband) if they approach each other (for a new marriage between themselves), provided both are certain that both will abide the ordainments of Allah. And these are the limits set by Allah. He explains them for the people who have knowledge"

And you shall not take them back to torture them or to take undue advantage. And whosoever does this — then certainly he has wronged his own self. And do not ridicule Allah’s statements. And bring to mind Allah’s grace on you and whatever He delivered to you as Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah. He guides you through it. And pay obedience to Allah and beware that verily, Allah is Aware of every thing"
