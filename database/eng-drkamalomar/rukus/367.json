But when you are invited then (only) you enter. Then when you have taken (your) meal, immediately disperse and be not Mustanesun for hadees (narration). Verily, such (a behaviour) from you used to annoy and hurt An-Nabi, but he hesitates regarding you, but Allah hesitates not regarding the truth. And when you ask those women for any thing, then ask those women from behind a screen. This (behaviour) from you (would be) purer for your hearts as well as for the hearts of these women. And it suits you not that you may hurt and annoy Rasul-ullah (Messenger of Allah), and nor that you may bring in (your) wedlock his wives after him — ever. Verily, this (attempt) of yours shall be, in the Sight of Allah, enormity"

O you who have Believed! Sallu alaihe (send blessings on him). [Please note: the practical implementation of this recommendation as required, is explained in Verse No. 33/43. We have to bring the personality of the Prophet from darknesses unto light. We will have to defend him on all fronts whenever he is attacked or his character assassination is done through the so-called Islamic literature produced by humans. Also note that the recommendation is in singular and is applicable to the Prophets’ person alone. Furthermore, it is enjoining a duty on we Muslims, and we are not supposed to revert it back to Allah, as our traditional greeting or ‘Durood-e-Ibrahim’ has taught us!] And submit (to the counsellings and ordainments in Al-Kitab) with complete submission (and inclination of the hearts)"
