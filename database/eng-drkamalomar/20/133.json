Each Surah in the Book of Allah is called a sahifah. And all the Surahs together are called Suhuf. Since Al-Kitab is permanent and eternal and also belonged to earlier and ancient times it is also called As-Suhuf-ul-oola. Similarly every Surah is collection of Writtings and all the Surahs together are the complete Divine Wirttings. To understand this point further, please see Verses]"
