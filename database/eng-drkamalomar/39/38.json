If Allah intended unto me some harm: whether those (deities) are rescuers for the harm inflicted by Him? (And) if He intended for me some mercy, whether those (deities) are those who would be able to withhold or stop His Mercy?” Say: \"Sufficient became to me, Allah. In Him put (their) trust those who put (their) trust (in the Right Authority).”"
