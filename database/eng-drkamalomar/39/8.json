    "text": "And when an infliction touched a human being, he called out his Nourisher-Sustainer as one who turns to Him (in repentance and obedience); but when He showered on him grace and favour from Himself, he forgot that (for which) he used to cry to Him since before; and he set up rivals to Allah so that (this rival authority) may mislead from His Path. Say: “Enjoy your disbelief a little; surely, you are of the dwellers of the Fire.”"
