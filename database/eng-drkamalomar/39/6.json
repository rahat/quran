And He has sent down for you of cattle — eight types. He creates you in the bellies of your mothers — creation after creation, in threefold darknesses. This is Allah to you — Nourisher-Sustainer unto you. For Him is the dominion. La-ilaha-illa-Huwa. How then you are turned away (from the Permanent Path)"
