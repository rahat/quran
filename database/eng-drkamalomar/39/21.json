    "text": "Don’t you see that Allah sent down from towards the sky — water? Then He caused it to penetrate (in the form of) streamlets in the earth. Afterwards He brings forth therewith herbage and crops — its colours being different. Then it grows to full bloom; (and) then you see it turned into yellow; then He reduces it to broken straw. Verily, in this is a sure admonition for those who possess understanding and intellect"
