    "text": "And those who have disbelieved said: “We shall never Believe in accordance with this Al-Quran and nor according to that which is in between its two hands.\" [They Believe not in Al-Quran being propagated to them through the mouth of the Prophet, and nor in Al-Kitab which is already available. They realise that Al-Kitab is Permanent and they still reject it]. And if you could see when the tansgressors are those made to stand before their Nourisher-Sustainer — some of them will make the blaming statement revert to some (other amongst themselves). Those who were prevailed upon will say to those who behaved in arrogance: “If you people were not (there to mislead us), surely we would have been Believers.”"
