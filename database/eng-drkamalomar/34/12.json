    "text": "And for Sulaiman (We subdued) the wind; its morning (stride from sunrise till midnoon was) a month (in journey), and its afternoon (stride from the decline of the sun to sunset was) a month (in journey, i.e., , in a day-time Sulaiman used to cover two monthsâ€™ travel). And We caused a fount of (molten) copper to flow for him. And (there were) from amongst jinns that would work between his two hands (i.e., before him or in his presence or under his command) under the permission of his Nourisher-Sustainer. And whosoever of them will show dereliction of duty against Our Command, We shall cause him to taste of the torment of the blazing Fire"
