    "text": "And a bearer of burdens shall not bear the burden of another one. And if one heavily laden (Nafs or personality) does call another towards (bearing) her load — (there) will not be lifted any thing out of it — even if he happened to be a close relation. Certainly, what (is a fact is that) you warn (only) those who fear (and remain mindful of) their Nourisher-Sustainer (even) unseen, and established Prayers. And whoever purifies, so surely, what (is a fact is that) he purifies in the interest of his own self. And to Allah is the final Returning Place"
