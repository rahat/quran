    "text": "And the two seas do not become equal and identical — this one is sweet, thirst-satisfying, its liquid-state pleasant to drink and swallow; while this (other one is) saltish, bitter and heavy — and from all you eat fresh tender meat and you bring out ornaments that you wear and put on. And you see the ships therein, cleavers (of sea-water) as they sail (through it), so that you may seek of His Bounty, and perchance you may pay thanks (to Allah)"
