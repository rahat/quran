    "text": "And Allah did create you (Adam) from dust, then (the offspring) from Nutfah then He made you pairs (male and female). And no female conceives, and nor she delivers, but with His Knowledge. And no aged man is granted a span of life, and nor a deduction is made from his life, but it is in record. [Any human being granted an extra-ordinary long life or an extra-ordinary short life will find the matter written in advance in the Record of events available with Allah]. Surely, this is quite easy for Allah (to do)"
