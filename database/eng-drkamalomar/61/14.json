    "text": "O you who have Believed! Become Ansarullah — the way said Iesa, son of Maryam to Al-Hawariyyun, “Who (would become) my Ansar (those who assist and help me) towards (the Cause of) Allah?” Al-Hawariyyun (the newly reverted ones) said: “We are Ansar unto Allah.” Then a group out of Bani Israiel accepted Faith while (the other) group disbelieved. So We assisted those who had Believed against their enemy, then they became uppermost ones"
