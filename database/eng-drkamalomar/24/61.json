    "text": "(There is) no restriction on the blind, and no blame on the lame, and no blame on the sick, and no (blame) on yourselves — that you may eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your paternal uncles, or the houses of your fathers’ sisters, or the houses of your maternal uncles, or the houses of your mothers’ sisters, or (from that) whereof you held the keys, or from (the house of) your personal friend. (Also there is) no restriction on you people whether you eat together or apart. But when you have entered a house, send greeting unto your own people with a greeting from Allah [i.e., the one which is prescribed by Allah in specified wordings: As-Salamu Alaikum (Peace and blessings be on you)]. (This prescribed greeting is) blessed and desirable. Thus Allah explains to you the Ayaat so that you may use intellect"
