    "text": "And those must wait who find not the financial means for Nikah (marriage) until Allah enriches them out of His Bounty. And those who seek a document (granting them independence) out of those whom your right hands held in trust — so write them (the document) if you knew in them good. And give them out of the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And compel not the females under your control towards undesirable state (of celibacy) — if they have decided protection (through a marriage-bond) — in order that you may seek the gain of the present life. And whoever compels them, then surely Allah, after their (coming under) compulsion will be Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful (to them)"
