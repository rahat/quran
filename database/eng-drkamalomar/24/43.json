    "text": "Don’t you see that Allah moves up the clouds, then creates a union between it, then makes it piled up, then you see rain-water makes an exit from in between it? And he sends down from towards the sky, from the mountains — therein is of (frozen, stored) ice. Then He reaches with it whom He thinks proper and diverts it away from whom He thinks proper. It appears that the vivid flash of its (i.e., the clouds’) lightning will pass away alongwith the eyes (i.e., the lightning flash will damage and blind the eye-sights of people)"
