    "text": "O you people who have Believed! Do not follow footsteps of the satan. And whoever follows footsteps of the satan, then verily, he (i.e., the satan) commands Al-Fahsha (obscenity, immorality and vulgarity) and Al-Munkar (the undesirable and the prohibited). And if (there is) not the Grace of Allah over you, and His Mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure (from sins). But Allah purifies whom he thinks proper. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
