    "text": "Allah is Noor of the heavens and the earth. (The) parable of His Noor is like a niche (and) inside it (is) a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant planet, lit from a blessed tree, — an olive (tree), not the eastern one (that gets sun-rays only in the morning), and not a western one (that gets sun-rays only in the evening), whose oil (it appears) would almost glow forth (of itself) even if fire does not ignite it (as its tree has remained exposed to the sun-rays all day long) — Noorun ala Noor (Light upon Light). Allah guides to His Noor (‘Light’. This is an attribute for Allah’s Book) whom He thinks proper. And Allah sets forth parables for mankind. And Allah is All-Aware of all things"
