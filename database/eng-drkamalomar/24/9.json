    "text": "And the fifth (testimony) that the wrath of Allah (be) upon her if he (i.e., her husband) is out of those who speak the truth. [Please note that in the law of evidence there is no difference between a male and a female. Rather, when both give identical evidence the punishment gets averted from the female — indicating that the evidence given by her has more credence and it prevails over the evidence given by her husband. Also note that ‘curse of Allah’ has been mentioned to warn the male, while much milder phrase ‘wrath of Allah’ has been used to warn the female. And the most important point evident and manifest over here is that the word Azaab in Verse No. 2 and Verse No. 8 refers to one and the same punishment — ‘to flog one hundred stripes in public.’ Allah’s Book makes no distinction between a married and an unmarried person, or between a male and a female regarding this punishment. No punishment, other than flogging, is mentioned for Zina anywhere, throughout the Text of Al-Kitab. We must now ponder as to why Allah placed the first verse in this Surah which acts as a pre-amble as well as a warning. Allah, the All-Knowing and All-Aware knew beforehand that books written and produced by humans would attempt to override the ordainments of the Book of Allah and create confusion about the law of punishment applicable to Zina]"
