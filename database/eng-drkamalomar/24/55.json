    "text": "Allah has promised those who have Believed amongst you and have performed righteous deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted succession to those before them; and that He will surely establish for them their Religion that which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange safety after their (state of) fear â€” they will pay obedience to Me (Alone), will not associate as partners to Me anything. And whoever disbelieved after this then those people: they are the Fasiqun"
