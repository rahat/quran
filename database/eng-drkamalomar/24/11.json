    "text": "Verily, those who came forward with the slander (a false charge against a chaste personality) are a small group out of you people. Don’t regard it something detrimental or evil for you. Nay, it is positive for you. For every man among them (will come the recompense for) that which he earned of the sin. And that one amongst them who picked up and brought forward the most serious (aspect) of that (slander) — for him is a most serious punishment"
