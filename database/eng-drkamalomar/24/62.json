    "text": "Surely, what (is a fact is that) the Believers are those who have Believed in Allah and His Messenger, and when they happened to be with him involved in some important matter, they do not move until they have obtained his permission. Surely, those who obtain your permission (before leaving) they are those who (really) Believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission in connection with some of their problem, then grant permission for whom you thought proper among them; and ask Allah for (giving) forgiveness to them. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
