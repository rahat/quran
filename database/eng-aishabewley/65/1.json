    "text": "O Prophet! When any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity and calculate their ´idda carefully. And have taqwa of Allah, your Lord. Do not evict them from their homes, nor should they leave, unless they commit an outright indecency. Those are Allah´s limits, and anyone who oversteps Allah´s limits has wronged himself. You never know, it may well be that after that Allah will cause a new situation to develop"
