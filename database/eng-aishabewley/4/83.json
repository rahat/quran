    "text": "When news of any matter reaches them they spread it about, whether it is of a reassuring or disquieting nature. If they had only referred it to the Messenger and those in command among them, those among them able to discern the truth about it would have had proper knowledge of it. If it were not for AllahÂ´s favour to you and His mercy, all but a very few of you would have followed Shaytan"
