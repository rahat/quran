    "text": "Do you not see those who were told: ´Hold back from fighting but establish salat and pay zakat´? Then when fighting is prescribed for them, a group of them fear people as Allah should be feared, or even more than that. They say, ´Our Lord, why have you prescribed fighting for us? If only You would give us just a little more time!´ Say, ´The enjoyment of this world is very brief. The Next World is better for those who have taqwa. You will not be wronged by so much as the smallest speck.´"
