    "text": "Haram for you are: your mothers and your daughters and your sisters, your maternal aunts and your paternal aunts, your brothers´ daughters and your sisters´ daughters, your foster mothers who have suckled you, your foster sisters by suckling, your wives´ mothers, your stepdaughters who are under your protection: the daughters of your wives whom you have had sexual relations with (though if you have not had sexual relations with them there is nothing blameworthy for you in it then), the wives of your sons whom you have fathered, and marrying two sisters at the same time — except for what may have already taken place. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
