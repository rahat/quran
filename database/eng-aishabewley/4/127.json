Say, ´Allah gives you a fatwa about them; and also what is recited to you in the Book about orphan girls to whom you do not give the inheritance they are owed, while at the same time desiring to marry them; and also about young children who are denied their rights: that you should act justly with respect to orphans.´ Whatever good you do, Allah knows it"
