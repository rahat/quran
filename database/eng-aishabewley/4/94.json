    "text": "You who have iman! when you go out to fight in the Way of Allah verify things carefully. Do not say, ´You are not a mumin´, to someone who greets you as a Muslim, simply out of desire for the goods of this world. With Allah there is booty in abundance. That is the way you were before but Allah has been kind to you. So verify things carefully. Allah is aware of what you do"
