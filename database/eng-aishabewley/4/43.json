    "text": "You who have iman! do not approach the prayer when you are drunk, so that you will know what you are saying, nor in a state of major impurity — unless you are travelling — until you have washed yourselves completely. If you are ill or on a journey, or any of you have come from the lavatory or touched women, and you cannot find any water, then do tayammum with pure earth, wiping your faces and your hands. Allah is Ever-Pardoning, Ever-Forgiving"
