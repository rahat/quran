    "text": "Some of the Jews distort the true meaning of words, saying,´We hear and disobey,´ and ´Listen without listening,´ and ´Ra´ina!´ twisting them with their tongues, disparaging the deen. If they had said, ´We hear and we obey,´ and ´Listen,´ and, ´Undhurna!´ that would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their kufr. Very few of them have iman"
