    "text": "When you said to him whom Allah has blessed and you yourself have greatly favoured, ´Keep your wife to yourself and have taqwa of Allah,´ while concealing something in yourself which Allah wished to bring to light, you were fearing people when Allah has more right to your fear. Then when Zayd divorced her We married her to you so that there should be no restriction for the muminun regarding the wives of their adopted sons when they have divorced them. Allah´s command is always carried out"
