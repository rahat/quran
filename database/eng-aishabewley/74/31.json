    "text": "We have only appointed angels as masters of the Fire and We have only specified their number as a trial for those who are kafir; so that those who were given the Book might gain in certainty, and those who have iman might increase in their iman, and both those who were given the Book and the muminun might have no doubt; and so that those with sickness in their hearts and the kuffar might say, ´What did Allah intend by this example?´ In this way Allah misguides those He wills and guides those He wills. No one knows the legions of your Lord but Him. This is nothing but a reminder to all human beings"
