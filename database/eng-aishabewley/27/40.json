    "text": "He who possessed knowledge of the Book said, ´I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.´ And when he saw it standing firmly in his presence, he said, ´This is part of my Lord´s favour to test me to see if I will give thanks or show ingratitude. Whoever gives thanks only does so to his own gain. Whoever is ungrateful, my Lord is Rich Beyond Need, Generous.´"
