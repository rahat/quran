He knows you will not keep count of it, so He has turned towards you. Recite as much of the Qur´an as is easy for you. He knows that some of you are ill and that others are travelling in the land seeking Allah´s bounty, and that others are fighting in the Way of Allah. So recite as much of it as is easy for you. And establish salat and pay zakat and lend a generous loan to Allah. Whatever good you send ahead for yourselves you will find it with Allah as something better and as a greater reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
