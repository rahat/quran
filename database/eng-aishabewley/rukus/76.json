Then the other group who have not yet prayed should come and pray with you. They too should be careful and keep hold of their weapons. Those who are kafir would like you to be negligent of your arms and equipment so that they can swoop down on you once and for all. There is nothing wrong, if you are bothered by rain or you are ill, in laying your weapons down; but take every precaution. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the kafirun"
