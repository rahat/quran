Go back to Egypt, then you will have what you are asking for.´ Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them. They brought down anger from Allah upon themselves. That was because they rejected Allah´s Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they rebelled and went beyond the limits"
