    "text": "When harm touches man he calls upon his Lord, making tawba to Him. Then when He grants him a blessing from Him, he forgets what he was calling for before and ascribes rivals to Allah, so as to misguide others from His Way. Say: ´Enjoy your kufr for a little while. You are among the Companions of the Fire.´"
