    "text": "When Musa returned to his people in anger and great sorrow, he said, ´What an evil thing you did in my absence after I left! Did you want to hasten your Lord´s command?´ He threw down the Tablets and seized hold of his brother´s head, dragging him towards him. Harun said, ´Son of my mother, The people oppressed me and almost killed me. Do not give my enemies cause to gloat over me. Do not include me with the wrongdoing people.´"
