    "text": "We divided them up into twelve tribes — communities. We revealed to Musa, when his people asked him for water: ´Strike the rock with your staff.´ Twelve fountains flowed out from it and all the people knew their drinking place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down manna and quails to them: ´Eat of the good things We have provided you with.´ They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they wronged"
