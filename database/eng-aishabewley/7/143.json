    "text": "When Musa came to Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ´My Lord, show me Yourself so that I may look at You!´ He said, ´You will not see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.´ But when His Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He crushed it flat and Musa fell unconscious to the ground. When he regained consciousness he said, ´Glory be to You! I make tawba to You and I am the first of the muminun!´"
