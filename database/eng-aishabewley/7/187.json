    "text": "They will ask you about the Hour: when is it due? Say: ´Knowledge of it rests with my Lord alone. He alone will reveal it at its proper time. It hangs heavy in the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly.´ They will ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say: ´Knowledge of it rests with Allah alone. But most people do not know that.´"
