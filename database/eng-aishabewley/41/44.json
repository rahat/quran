    "text": "If We had made it a Qur´an in a foreign tongue they would have said, ´Why have its Signs not been made plain? What! A foreign language for an Arab?´ Say: ´It is guidance and healing for people who have iman. Those who do not have iman have heaviness in their ears and for them it is blindness. Such people are being called from a very distant place.´"
