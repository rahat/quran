    "text": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or who says, ´It has been revealed to me,´ when nothing has been revealed to him, or someone who says, ´I will send down the same as Allah has sent down´? If you could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death when the angels are stretching out their hands, saying, ´Disgorge your own selves! Today you will be repaid with the punishment of humiliation for saying something other than the truth about Allah, and being arrogant about His Signs.´"
