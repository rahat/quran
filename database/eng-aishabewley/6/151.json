    "text": "Say: ´Come and I will recite to you what your Lord has made haram for you´: that you do not associate anything with Him; that you are good to your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty — We will provide for you and them; that you do not approach indecency — outward or inward; that you do not kill any person Allah has made inviolate — except with the right to do so. That is what He instructs you to do so that hopefully you will use your intellect"
