    "text": "Nor can you say: ´If the Book had been sent down to us, We would have been better guided than they were.´ For a Clear Sign has come to you from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who could do greater wrong than someone who denies Allah´s Signs and turns away from them? We will repay those who turn away from Our Signs with the worst kind of punishment because they turned away"
