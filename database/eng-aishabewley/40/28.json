    "text": "A man among Pharaoh´s people who had iman, but kept his iman concealed, said, ´Are you going to kill a man for saying \"My Lord is Allah\" when he has brought you Clear Signs from your Lord? If he is telling a lie, be it on his own head. But if he is telling the truth, then some of what he is promising you will certainly happen to you. Allah does not guide any unbridled inveterate liar"
