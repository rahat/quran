    "text": "They will be plunged into abasement wherever they are found, unless they have a treaty with Allah and with the people. They have brought down anger from Allah upon themselves, and they have been plunged into destitution. That was because they rejected AllahÂ´s Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they disobeyed and went beyond the limits"
