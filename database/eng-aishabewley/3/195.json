    "text": "Their Lord responds to them: ´I will not let the deeds of any doer among you go to waste, male or female — you are both the same in that respect. Those who made hijra and were driven from their homes and suffered harm in My Way and fought and were killed, I will erase their bad actions from them and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, as a reward from Allah. The best of all rewards is with Allah.´"
