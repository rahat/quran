I will create the shape of a bird out of clay for you and then breathe into it and it will be a bird by Allah´s permission. I will heal the blind and lepers, and bring the dead to life, by Allah´s permission. I will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your homes. There is a Sign for you in that if you are muminun"
