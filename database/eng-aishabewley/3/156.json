    "text": "You who have iman! do not be like those who are kafir and say of their brothers, when they are going on journeys or military expeditions, ´If they had only been with us, they would not have died or been killed,´ so that Allah can make that anguish for them in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives life and causes to die. Allah sees what you do"
