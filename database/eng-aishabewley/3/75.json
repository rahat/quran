    "text": "Among the People of the Book there are some who, if you entrust them with a pile of gold, will return it to you. But there are others among them who, if you entrust them with just a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you stay standing over them. That is because they say, ´We are under no obligation where the gentiles are concerned.´ They tell a lie against Allah and they know it"
