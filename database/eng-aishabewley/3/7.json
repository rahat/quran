    "text": "It is He who sent down the Book to you from Him: ayats containing clear judgements — they are the core of the Book — and others which are open to interpretation. Those with deviation in their hearts follow what is open to interpretation in it, desiring conflict, seeking its inner meaning. No one knows its inner meaning but Allah. Those firmly rooted in knowledge say, ´We have iman in it. All of it is from our Lord.´ But only people of intelligence pay heed"
