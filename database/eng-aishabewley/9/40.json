    "text": "If you do not help him, Allah did help him when the kuffar drove him out and there were two of them in the Cave.* He said to his companion, ´Do not be despondent, Allah is with us.´ Then Allah sent down His serenity upon him and reinforced him with troops you could not see. He made the word of the kuffar undermost. It is the word of Allah which is uppermost. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise"
