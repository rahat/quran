    "text": "That was the situation when we woke them up so they could question one another. One of them asked, ´How long have you been here?´ They replied, ´We have been here for a day or part of a day.´ They said, ´Your Lord knows best how long you have been here. Send one of your number into the city with this silver you have, so he can see which food is purest and bring you some of it to eat. But he should go about with caution so that no one is aware of you"
