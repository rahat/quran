    "text": "You would have seen the sun, when it rose, inclining away from their cave towards the right, and, when it set, leaving them behind on the left, while they were lying in an open part of it. That was one of AllahÂ´s Signs. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But if He misguides someone, you will find no protector for them to guide them rightly"
