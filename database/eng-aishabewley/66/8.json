    "text": "You who have iman! repent sincerely to Allah. It may be that your Lord will erase your bad actions from you and admit you into Gardens with rivers flowing under them on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who had iman along with him. Their light will stream out ahead of them and on their right. They will say, ´Our Lord, perfect our light for us and forgive us! You have power over all things.´"
