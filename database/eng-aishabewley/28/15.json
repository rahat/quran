    "text": "He entered the city at a time when its inhabitants were unaware and found two men fighting there — one from his party and the other from his enemy. The one from his party asked for his support against the other from his enemy. So Musa hit him, dealing him a fatal blow. He said, ´This is part of Shaytan´s handiwork. He truly is an outright and misleading enemy.´"
