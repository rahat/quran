    "text": "Say to the mumin women that they should lower their eyes and guard their private parts and not display their adornments — except for what normally shows — and draw their head-coverings across their breasts. They should only display their adornments to their husbands or their fathers or their husbands´ fathers, or their sons or their husbands´ sons or their brothers or their brothers´ sons or their sisters´ sons or other women or those they own as slaves or their male attendants who have no sexual desire or children who still have no awareness of women´s private parts. Nor should they stamp their feet so that their hidden ornaments are known. Turn to Allah every one of you, muminun, so that hopefully you will have success"
