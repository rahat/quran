    "text": "There is no objection to the blind, no objection to the lame, no objection to the sick nor to yourselves if you eat in your own houses or your fathers´ houses or your mothers´ houses or your brothers´ houses or your sisters´ houses or the houses of your paternal uncles or paternal aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or maternal aunts or places to which you own the keys or those of your friends. There is nothing wrong in your eating together or eating separately. And when you enter houses greet one another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and good. In this way Allah makes the Signs clear to you so that hopefully you will use your intellect"
