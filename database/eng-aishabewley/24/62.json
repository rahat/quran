    "text": "The muminun are those who have iman in Allah and His Messenger and who, when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not leave until they have asked him for permission. Those people who ask you for permission are the ones who truly have iman in Allah and His Messenger. If they ask your permission to attend to their own affairs, give permission to any of them you please; and ask AllahÂ´s forgiveness for them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
