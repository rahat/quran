    "text": "Even if there was a Qur´an which moved mountains, or split the earth open or spoke to the dead . . .! On the contrary! The affair is Allah´s altogether. Do those who have iman not know that if Allah had wanted to He could have guided all mankind? Those who are kafir will not cease to be struck by disaster for what they have done — or a disaster will happen close to their homes — until Allah´s promise is fulfilled. Allah will not fail to keep His promise"
