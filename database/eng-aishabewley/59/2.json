    "text": "It is He who expelled those who were kafir among the People of the Book from their homes to the first gathering-place.* You did not think that they would leave and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah. Then Allah came upon them from where they least expected it and cast terror into their hearts. Their houses were pulled down by their own hands and by the hands of the muminun. People of insight, take note"
