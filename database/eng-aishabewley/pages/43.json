Ibrahim said, ´My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die.´ He said, ´I too give life and cause to die.´ Ibrahim said, ´Allah makes the sun come from the East. Make it come from the West.´ And the one who was a kafir was dumbfounded. Allah does not guide wrongdoing people"

He asked, ´How can Allah restore this to life when it has died?´ Allah caused him to die a hundred years then brought him back to life. Then He asked, ´How long have you been here?´ He replied, ´I have been here a day or part of a day.´ He said, ´Not so! You have been here a hundred years. Look at your food and drink — it has not gone bad — and look at your donkey so We can make you a Sign for all mankind. Look at the bones — how We raise them up and clothe them in flesh.´ When it had become clear to him, he said, ´Now I know that Allah has power over all things.´"
