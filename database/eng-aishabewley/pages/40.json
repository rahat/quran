He said, ´Is it not possible that if fighting were prescribed for you, you would not fight?´ They said, ´How could we not fight in the way of Allah when we have been driven from our homes and children?´ But then when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs — except for a few of them. Allah knows the wrongdoers"
