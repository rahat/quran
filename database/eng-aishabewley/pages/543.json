Three men cannot confer together secretly without Him being the fourth of them, or five without Him being the sixth of them, or fewer than that or more without Him being with them wherever they are. Then He will inform them on the Day of Rising of what they did. Allah has knowledge of all things"

And when they come to you they greet you with words Allah has never used in greeting you, and say to themselves ´Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?´ Hell will be enough for them! They will roast in it. What an evil destination"
