Today the kuffar have despaired of overcoming your deen. So do not be afraid of them but be afraid of Me. Today I have perfected your deen for you and completed My blessing upon you and I am pleased with Islam as a deen for you. But if anyone is forced by hunger, not intending any wrongdoing, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"

Say: ´All good things are halal for you, and also what is caught for you by hunting animals which you have trained as Allah has taught you. Eat what they catch for you, mentioning Allah´s name over it.´ And have taqwa of Allah. Allah is swift at reckoning"

So are free women from among the muminun and free women of those given the Book before you, once you have given them their dowries in marriage, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. But as for anyone who rejects iman, his actions will come to nothing and in the Next World he will be among the losers"
