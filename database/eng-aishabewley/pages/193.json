One year they make it profane and another sacred to tally with the number Allah has made sacred. In that way they profane what Allah has made sacred. Their bad actions are made to seem good to them. Allah does not guide kafir people"

He made the word of the kuffar undermost. It is the word of Allah which is uppermost. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise"
