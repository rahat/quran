That is because they say, ´Trade is the same as usury.´ But Allah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury. Whoever is given a warning by his Lord and then desists, may keep what he received in the past and his affair is Allah´s concern. But all who return to it will be the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"
