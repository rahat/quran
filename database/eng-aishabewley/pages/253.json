Do those who have iman not know that if Allah had wanted to He could have guided all mankind? Those who are kafir will not cease to be struck by disaster for what they have done — or a disaster will happen close to their homes — until Allah´s promise is fulfilled. Allah will not fail to keep His promise"

Or would you inform Him of something in the earth He does not know, or are they words which are simply guesswork on your part?´ However, the plotting of those who are kafir seems good to them and they bar the way. Anyone misguided by Allah has no guide"
