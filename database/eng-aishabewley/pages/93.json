Anyone who kills a mumin by mistake should free a mumin slave and pay blood-money to his family unless they forgo it as a sadaqa. If he is from a people who are your enemies and is a mumin, you should free a mumin slave. If he is from a people you have a treaty with, blood money should be paid to his family and you should free a mumin slave. Anyone who cannot find the means should fast two consecutive months. This is a concession from Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"

Do not say, ´You are not a mumin´, to someone who greets you as a Muslim, simply out of desire for the goods of this world. With Allah there is booty in abundance. That is the way you were before but Allah has been kind to you. So verify things carefully. Allah is aware of what you do"
