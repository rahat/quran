Women possess rights similar to those held over them to be honoured with fairness; but men have a degree above them. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise"

It is not lawful for you to keep anything you have given them unless a couple fear that they will not remain within Allah´s limits. If you fear that they will not remain within Allah´s limits, there is nothing wrong in the wife ransoming herself with some of what she received. These are Allah´s limits, so do not overstep them. Those who overstep Allah´s limits are wrongdoers"

Then if he divorces her, there is nothing wrong in the original couple getting back together provided they think they will remain within Allah´s limits. These are Allah´s limits which He has made clear to people who know"
