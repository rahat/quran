Or are darkness and light the same? Or have they assigned partners to Allah who create as He creates, so that all creating seems the same to them?´ Say: ´Allah is the Creator of everything. He is the One, the All-Conquering.´"

That is how Allah depicts the true and the false. As for the scum, it is quickly swept away. But as for that which is of use to people, it remains behind in the ground. That is a metaphor which Allah has made"

Their shelter will be Hell. What an evil resting-place"
