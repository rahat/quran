Do not evict them from their homes, nor should they leave, unless they commit an outright indecency. Those are Allah´s limits, and anyone who oversteps Allah´s limits has wronged himself. You never know, it may well be that after that Allah will cause a new situation to develop"

Call two upright men from among yourselves as witnesses and they should carry out the witnessing for Allah. This is admonishment for all who have iman in Allah and the Last Day. Whoever has taqwa of Allah — He will give him a way out"
