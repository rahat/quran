Allah has inscribed iman upon such peopleÂ´s hearts and will reinforce them with a Ruh from Him and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. Such people are the party of Allah. Truly it is the party of Allah who are successful"

Then Allah came upon them from where they least expected it and cast terror into their hearts. Their houses were pulled down by their own hands and by the hands of the muminun. People of insight, take note"
