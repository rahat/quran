Those who listen to lies listen to other people who have not come to you, distorting words from their proper meanings, saying, ´If you are given this, then take it. If you are not given it, then beware!´ If Allah desires misguidance for someone, you cannot help him against Allah in any way. Those are the people whose hearts Allah does not want to purify. They will have disgrace in this world and in the Next World they will have a terrible punishment"
