We gave Clear Signs to Â´Isa, son of Maryam, and reinforced him with the Purest Ruh. If Allah had willed, those who came after them would not have fought each other after the Clear Signs came to them, but they differed. Among them there are those who have iman and among them there are those who are kafir. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other. But Allah does whatever He desires"

Who can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them but they cannot grasp any of His knowledge save what He wills. His Footstool encompasses the heavens and the earth and their preservation does not tire Him. He is the Most High, the Magnificent"
