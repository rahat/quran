    "text": "Divorce can be pronounced two times; in which case wives may be retained with correctness and courtesy or released with good will. It is not lawful for you to keep anything you have given them unless a couple fear that they will not remain within Allah´s limits. If you fear that they will not remain within Allah´s limits, there is nothing wrong in the wife ransoming herself with some of what she received. These are Allah´s limits, so do not overstep them. Those who overstep Allah´s limits are wrongdoers"
