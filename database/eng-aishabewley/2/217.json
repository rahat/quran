    "text": "They will ask you about the Sacred Month and fighting in it. Say, ´Fighting in it is a serious matter; but barring access to the Way of Allah and rejecting Him and barring access to the Masjid al-Haram and expelling its people from it are far more serious in the sight of Allah. Fitna is worse than killing.´ They will not stop fighting you until they make you revert from your deen, if they are able. As for any of you who revert from their deen and die kafir, their actions will come to nothing in this world and the Next World. They are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"
