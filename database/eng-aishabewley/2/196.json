    "text": "Perform the hajj and ´umra for Allah. If you are forcibly prevented, make whatever sacrifice is feasible. But do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached the place of sacrifice. If any of you are ill or have a head injury, the expiation is fasting or sadaqa or sacrifice when you are safe and well again. Anyone who comes out of ihram between ´umra and hajj should make whatever sacrifice is feasible. For any one who cannot, there are three days´ fast on hajj and seven on your return — that is ten in all. That is for anyone whose family does not live near the Masjid al-Haram. Have taqwa of Allah and know that Allah is severe in retribution"
