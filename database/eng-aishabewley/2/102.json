Sulayman did not become kafir, but the shaytans did, teaching people sorcery and what had been sent down to Harut and Marut, the two angels in Babylon, who taught no one without first saying to him, ´We are merely a trial and temptation, so do not become kafir.´ People learned from them how to separate a man and his wife but they cannot harm anyone by it, except with Allah´s permission. They have learned what will harm them and will not benefit them. They know that any who deal in it will have no share in Next World. What an evil thing they have sold themselves for if they only knew"
