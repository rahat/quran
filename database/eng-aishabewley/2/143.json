    "text": "In this way We have made you a middlemost community, so that you may act as witnesses against mankind and the Messenger as a witness against you. We only appointed the direction you used to face in order to distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn round on their heels. Though in truth it is a very hard thing â€” except for those Allah has guided. Allah would never let your iman go to waste. Allah is All-Gentle, Most Merciful to mankind"
