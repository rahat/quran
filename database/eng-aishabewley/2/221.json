    "text": "Do not marry women of the idolaters until they have iman. A slavegirl who is one of the muminun is better for you than a woman of the idolaters, even though she may attract you. And do not give (your women) in marriage to men of the mushrikun until they have iman. A slave who is one of the muminun is better for you than a man of the idolaters, even though he may attract you. Such people call you to the Fire whereas Allah calls you, with His permission, to the Garden and forgiveness. He makes His Signs clear to people so that hopefully they will pay heed"
