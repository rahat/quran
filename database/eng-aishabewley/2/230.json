    "text": "But if a man divorces his wife a third time, she is not halal for him after that until she has married another husband. Then if he divorces her, there is nothing wrong in the original couple getting back together provided they think they will remain within Allah´s limits. These are Allah´s limits which He has made clear to people who know"
