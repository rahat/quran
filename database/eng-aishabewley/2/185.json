    "text": "The month of Ramadan is the one in which the Qur´an was sent down as guidance for mankind, with Clear Signs containing guidance and discrimination. Any of you who are resident for the month should fast it. But any of you who are ill or on a journey should fast a number of other days. Allah desires ease for you; He does not desire difficulty for you. You should complete the number of days and proclaim Allah´s greatness for the guidance He has given you so that hopefully you will be thankful"
