    "text": "And when you said, ´Musa, we will not put up with just one kind of food so ask your Lord to supply to us some of what the earth produces — its green vegetables, cucumbers, grains, lentils and onions,´ he said, ´Do you want to replace what is better with what is inferior? Go back to Egypt, then you will have what you are asking for.´ Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them. They brought down anger from Allah upon themselves. That was because they rejected Allah´s Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they rebelled and went beyond the limits"
