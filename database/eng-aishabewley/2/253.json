    "text": "These Messengers: We favoured some of them over others. Allah spoke directly to some of them and raised up some of them in rank. We gave Clear Signs to Â´Isa, son of Maryam, and reinforced him with the Purest Ruh. If Allah had willed, those who came after them would not have fought each other after the Clear Signs came to them, but they differed. Among them there are those who have iman and among them there are those who are kafir. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other. But Allah does whatever He desires"
