    "text": "Do jihad for Allah with the jihad due to Him. He has selected you and not placed any constraint upon you in the deen — the religion of your forefather Ibrahim. He named you Muslims before and also in this, so that the Messenger could be witness against you and you could be witnesses against all mankind. So establish salat and pay zakat and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector — the Best Protector, the Best Helper"
