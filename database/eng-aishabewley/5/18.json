    "text": "The Jews and Christians say, ´We are Allah´s children and His loved ones.´ Say: ´Why, then, does He punish you for your wrong actions? No, you are merely human beings among those He has created. He forgives whoever He wills and He punishes whoever He wills. The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything between them belongs to Allah. He is our final destination.´"
