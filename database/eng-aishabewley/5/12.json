    "text": "Allah made a covenant with the tribe of Israel and We raised up twelve leaders from among them. Allah said, ´I am with you. If you establish salat and pay zakat, and have iman in My Messengers and respect and support them, and make a generous loan to Allah, I will erase your wrong actions from you and admit you into Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Any of you who are kafir after that have gone astray from the right way.´"
