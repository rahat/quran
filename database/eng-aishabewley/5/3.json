    "text": "Haram for you are carrion, blood and pork, and what has been consecrated to other than Allah, and animals which have been strangled, and animals which have been killed by a blow, and animals which have fallen to their death, and animals which have been gored, and animals which wild beasts have eaten — except those you are able to slaughter properly — and animals which have been sacrificed on altars, and deciding things by means of divining arrows — that is deviance. Today the kuffar have despaired of overcoming your deen. So do not be afraid of them but be afraid of Me. Today I have perfected your deen for you and completed My blessing upon you and I am pleased with Islam as a deen for you. But if anyone is forced by hunger, not intending any wrongdoing, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
