    "text": "We sent down the Torah containing guidance and light, and the Prophets who had submitted themselves gave judgement by it for the Jews — as did their scholars and their rabbis — by what they had been allowed to preserve of Allah´s Book to which they were witnesses. Do not be afraid of people, be afraid of Me. And do not sell My Signs for a paltry price. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down, such people are kafirun"
