And We inspired to Moses when his people implored him for water, \"Strike with your staff the stone,\" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Every people knew its watering place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not, but they were [only] wronging themselves"
