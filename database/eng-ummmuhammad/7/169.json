    "text": "And there followed them successors who inherited the Scripture [while] taking the commodities of this lower life and saying, \"It will be forgiven for us.\" And if an offer like it comes to them, they will [again] take it. Was not the covenant of the Scripture taken from them that they would not say about Allah except the truth, and they studied what was in it? And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, so will you not use reason"
