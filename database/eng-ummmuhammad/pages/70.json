They say, \"If there was anything we could have done in the matter, some of us would not have been killed right here.\" Say, \"Even if you had been inside your houses, those decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds.\" [It was] so that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts. And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts"
