And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors"

That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment"
