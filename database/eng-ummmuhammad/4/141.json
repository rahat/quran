Then if you gain a victory from Allah, they say, \"Were we not with you?\" But if the disbelievers have a success, they say [to them], \"Did we not gain the advantage over you, but we protected you from the believers?\" Allah will judge between [all of] you on the Day of Resurrection, and never will Allah give the disbelievers over the believers a way [to overcome them]"
