    "text": "Have you not seen those who were told, \"Restrain your hands [from fighting] and establish prayer and give zakah\"? But then when fighting was ordained for them, at once a party of them feared men as they fear Allah or with [even] greater fear. They said, \"Our Lord, why have You decreed upon us fighting? If only You had postponed [it for] us for a short time.\" Say, The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for he who fears Allah. And injustice will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed]"
