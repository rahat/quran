    "text": "They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, \"Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs].\" If a man dies, leaving no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will have two-thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male will have the share of two females. Allah makes clear to you [His law], lest you go astray. And Allah is Knowing of all things"
