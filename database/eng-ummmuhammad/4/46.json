    "text": "Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, \"We hear and disobey\" and \"Hear but be not heard\" and \"Ra'ina,\" twisting their tongues and defaming the religion. And if they had said [instead], \"We hear and obey\" and \"Wait for us [to understand],\" it would have been better for them and more suitable. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few"
