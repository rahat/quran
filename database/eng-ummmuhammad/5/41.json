    "text": "O Messenger, let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief of those who say, \"We believe\" with their mouths, but their hearts believe not, and from among the Jews. [They are] avid listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have not come to you. They distort words beyond their [proper] usages, saying \"If you are given this, take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.\" But he for whom Allah intends fitnah - never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against Allah. Those are the ones for whom Allah does not intend to purify their hearts. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment"
