    "text": "Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after [the time of] Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs, \"Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah \"? He said, \"Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you?\" They said, \"And why should we not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?\" But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers"
