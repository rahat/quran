As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And no one will be reminded except those of understanding"
