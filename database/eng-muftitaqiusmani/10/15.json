    "text": "When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, say those who do not believe in meeting Us, “Bring a Qur’ān other than this, or make changes in it (to suit our fancies)”. Say, “It is not possible for me to make changes in it on my own. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a terrible day.”"
