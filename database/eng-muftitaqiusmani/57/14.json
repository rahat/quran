    "text": "They (the hypocrites) will call out to them (the believers), “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, (you were,) but you led your souls to a wrong way, and kept waiting (for an evil end to the Muslims), and remained in doubt, and were deluded by fancies, until Allah’s command came to pass, and you were deceived about Allah by the Big Deceiver (Iblīs)"
