But when fear comes, you will see them looking towards you, rolling their eyes, like the one who gets faint because of death. Then once fear is gone, they assail you with sharp tongues, in greed for the good (i.e. the wealth acquired as spoils). These people did not accept faith (in real terms), therefore Allah has nullified their acts. All this is so easy for Allah"
