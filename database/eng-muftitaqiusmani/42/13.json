    "text": "He has ordained for you people the same religion as He had enjoined upon NūH, and that which We have revealed to you (O prophet,) and that which We had enjoined upon Ibrāhīm and Mūsā and ‘Īsā by saying, “Establish the religion, and be not divided therein.” Arduous for the mushriks (polytheists) is that to which you are inviting them. Allah chooses (and pulls) toward Himself anyone He wills, and guides to Himself anyone who turns to Him (to seek guidance)"
