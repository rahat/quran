    "text": "Said the one who had the knowledge of the book, “I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.” So when he saw it (the throne) well placed before him, he said, “This is by the grace of my Lord, so that He may test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Need-Free, Bountiful”"
