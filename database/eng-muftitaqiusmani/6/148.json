    "text": "Those who associate partners with Allah will say, “Had Allah willed, we would have not associated (partners with Him), nor our fathers, nor would we have made anything prohibited.” In the same way those who went before them gave the lie to (the truth) until they tasted Our punishment. Say, “Do you have any sure knowledge that you may produce to us? You follow nothing but whims, and do nothing but make conjectures"
