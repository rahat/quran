    "text": "The day He will assemble all of them together, (Allah will say to Jinn) “O species of Jinns, you have done too much against mankind.” Their friends from among the human beings will say, “Our Lord, some of us have benefited from others, and we have reached our term that You had appointed for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your Abode wherein you will remain for ever, unless Allah wills (otherwise). Surely, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.”"
