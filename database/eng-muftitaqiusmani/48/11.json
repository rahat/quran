    "text": "Those of the Bedouins who remained behind will say to you, “Our possessions and our families kept us busy, (hence we could not accompany you in your journey to Hudaibiyah). So, pray to Allah for our forgiveness.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.Say, “Then, who has power to help you in any thing against Allah, if He intends to do you harm, or intends to do you good? Rather, Allah is fully aware of what you do"
