    "text": "Or, (do you not know) the example of the one who passed through a town that had collapsed on its roofs. He said: “How shall Allah revive this after it is dead?” So, Allah made him dead for a hundred years, then raised him saying: “How long did you remain (in this state)?” He said: “I remained for a day or part of a day”. Said He: “Rather, you remained (dead) for a hundred years. Just look at your food and your drink; it has not spoiled. Now look at your donkey. (We did) this to make you a sign for people! Look at the bones, how We raise them, then dress them with flesh.” So, when it was clear to him, he said: “I know that Allah is Powerful over everything.”"
