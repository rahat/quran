    "text": "Do you not know the one who argued with Ibrāhīm about his Lord, because Allah had given him kingship? When Ibrāhīm said: “My Lord is the One Who gives life and brings death,” he said: “I give life and I bring death.” Said Ibrāhīm: “Allah brings the sun out from the East; now, you bring it out from the West.” Here, baffled was the one who disbelieved, and Allah does not bring the wrongdoers to the right path"
