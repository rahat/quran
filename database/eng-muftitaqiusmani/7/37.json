They shall receive their share from that (sustenance) which is written (for them in their destiny) until, when Our envoys (angels) shall come to them to take their souls away, they (the angels) will say, “Where are those (so-called gods) whom you used to invoke besides Allah?” They (the unbelievers) will say, “They all have vanished from us”, and they shall testify against themselves that they were unbelievers"
