    "text": "They swear by Allah that they said nothing, while indeed, they had said the word of infidelity and had disbelieved after having accepted Islam, and had intended what they could not achieve. And they have reacted for nothing but that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them with His grace.So, if they repent, it will be good for them, and if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and for them there is neither a friend on the Earth, nor a helper"
