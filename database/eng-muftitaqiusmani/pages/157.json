The day when its final result will come, those who had ignored it earlier will say, “Surely, the messengers of our Lord had come with truth. So, are there any intercessors for us who could intercede in our favor? Or, could we be sent back, so that we might do contrary to what we used to do?” Indeed, they have put their selves to loss, and vanished from them all that they used to fabricate"
