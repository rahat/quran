May you not be made to hear,” and “Rā‘inā”, twisting their tongues and maligning the Faith.If they had said, “We hear and obey,” and “Hear,” and “Look after us,” it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allah has cast His curse on them due to their disbelief. So, they do not believe except a few"
