    "text": "O you who believe, when you go out in the way of Allah, be careful, and do not say to the one who offers you the Salām (salutation), “You are not a believer” to seek stuff of the worldly life. So, with Allah there are spoils in abundance. In the same state you were before; then Allah favored you. So, be careful. Surely, Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
