    "text": "Have you not seen those to whom it was said, “Hold your hands (from fighting) and be steadfast in Salāh and pay Zakāh.” However, when fighting is enjoined upon them, then surprisingly, a group from them starts fearing people, as one would fear Allah, or fearing even more.They say, “Our Lord, why have you enjoined fighting upon us? Would you have not spared us for a little more time?” Say, “The enjoyment of the world is but a little, and the Hereafter is far better for the one who fears Allah, and you shall not be wronged, even to the measure of a fiber"
