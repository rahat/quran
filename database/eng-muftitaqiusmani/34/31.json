    "text": "Those who disbelieve say, “We will never believe in this Qur’ān, nor in that which was before it.” But if only you could see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, repulsing words (of blame) to one another! Those who were held as weak will say to the overbearing, “Had you not been there, we would have been believers.”"
