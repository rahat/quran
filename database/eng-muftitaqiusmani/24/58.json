    "text": "O you who believe, the slaves owned by you, and those of you who have not reached puberty, must seek your permission (to see you) at three times: before the prayer of Fajr, and when you take off your clothes at noon, and after the prayer of ‘Ishā’. These are three times of privacy for you. There is no harm, neither to you nor to them, after these (three times). They are your frequent visitors, as some of you are (frequent visitors) of the others. This is how Allah explains the verses to you. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
