    "text": "O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brethren while they travelled on the earth or had to fight, “Had they been with us, they would have not died, nor would they have been killed.” The result is that Allah makes it a remorse resting in their hearts. Allah gives life and brings death; Allah is watchful of what you do"
