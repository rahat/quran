    "text": "But do not believe (for real) except in those who follow your faith.” Say, “(Real) guidance is the guidance of Allah.” (But all that you do is due to your envy) that someone is given what is similar to that which you have been given, or that they argue against you before your Lord.” Say, “The bounty is in the hands of Allah. He gives it to whom He wills. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing"
