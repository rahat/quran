    "text": "And said a believing man from the House of Pharaoh who had kept his faith secret, “Would you kill a man because he says - ‘Allah is my Lord’ - while he has come to you with clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lie will fall back on himself, and if he is truthful, some of that (punishment) of which he warns you will afflict you. Indeed, Allah does not give guidance to anyone who is transgressor, a liar"
