Be ye helpers of God: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples, \"Who will be my helpers to (the work of) God?\" Said the disciples, \"We are God's helpers!\" then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed"
