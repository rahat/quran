    "text": "When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat), either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but do not take them back to injure them, (or) to take undue advantage; if any one does that; He w rongs his own soul.

And fear God, and know that God is well acquainted with all things"
