Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye may give away somethin g, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that God is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise"
