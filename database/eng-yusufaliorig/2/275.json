    "text": "Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: \"Trade is like usury,\" but God hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direc tion from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for God (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever)"
