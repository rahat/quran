    "text": "They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: \"Fighting therein is a grave (offence); but graver is it in the sight of God to prevent access to the path of God, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive ou t its members.\" Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in t his life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein"
