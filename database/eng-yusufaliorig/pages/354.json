And if any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing (to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum), give them suc h a deed if ye know any good in them: yea, give them something yourselves out of the means which God has given to you. But force not your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that ye may make a gain in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them, yet, after such compulsion, is God, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (to them)"

God doth guide whom He will to His Light: God doth set forth Parables for men: and God doth know all things"
