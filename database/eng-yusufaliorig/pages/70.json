They said: \"What a ffair is this of ours?\" Say thou: \"Indeed, this affair is wholly God's.\" They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): \"If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here .\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\"; but (all this was) that God might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For God kno weth well the secrets of your hearts"

It is God that gives Life and Death, and God sees well all that ye do"
