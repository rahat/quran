Show me how Thou givest life to the dead.\" He said: \"Dost thou not then believe?\" He said: \"Yea! but to satisfy My own undertaking.\" He said: \"Take four birds; Tame them to turn to thee; put a portion of them on every hill and call to them: They will come to thee (Flying) with speed.

And God guideth not those who reject faith"
