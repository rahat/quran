If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God, there is no blame on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the limi ts ordained by God; so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by God, such persons wrong (Themselves as well as others)"
