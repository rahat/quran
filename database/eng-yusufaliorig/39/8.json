    "text": "When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself, (man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set up rivals unto God, thus mis leading others from God's Path. Say, \"Enjoy thy blasphemy for a little while: verily thou art (one) of the Companions of the Fire"
