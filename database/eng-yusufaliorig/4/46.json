    "text": "Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: \"We hear and we disobey\"; and \"Hear what is not Heard\"; and \"Ra'ina\"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: \"We hear and we obey\"; and \"Do hear\"; and \"Do look at us\"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but God hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe"
