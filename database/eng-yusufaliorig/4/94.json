    "text": "O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of God, investigate carefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: \"Thou art none of a believer!\" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with God are profits and spoils abun dant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till God conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For God is well aware of all that ye do"
