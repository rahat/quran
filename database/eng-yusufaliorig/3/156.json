    "text": "O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.\" This that God may make it a caus e of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is God that gives Life and Death, and God sees well all that ye do"
