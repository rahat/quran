And they hold secret counsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility, and disobedience to the Apostle. And w hen they come to thee, they salute thee, not as God salutes thee, (but in crooked ways): And they say to themselves, \"Why does not God punish us for our words?\" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn, and evil is that destination"
