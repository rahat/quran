    "text": "O Apostle! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say \"We believe\" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, \"If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!\" If any one's trial is intended by God, thou hast no authority in the least for him against God. For such - it is not God's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment"
