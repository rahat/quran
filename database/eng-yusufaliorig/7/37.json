For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: \"Where a re the things that ye used to invoke besides God?\" They will reply, \"They have left us in the lurch,\" And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected God"
