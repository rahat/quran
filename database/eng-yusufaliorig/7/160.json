    "text": "We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: \"Strike the rock with thy staff\": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for w ater. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you\": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls"
